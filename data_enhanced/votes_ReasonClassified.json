Naturally it's a contentious and painful topic to discuss. Before seeing what the project delivers, how are we to know what the success reward should be? People are mostly arguing that 1 noun is a lot, but it can also be much too little. Ultimately, the correct success reward is infinitely harder to decide upon before the fact and can lead to much wasted heartburn each time. This is why I‚Äôd advocate for us to put into place something like [Retroactive Impact Rewards - Nouns](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/retroactive-impact-rewards/884) to establish trust with proposers that we will reward success fairly and generously such that we can move the reward discussion moment to AFTER the project is delivered rather than before. In lack of such process and trust in the current state, I do not see it as bad faith or form that a proposer asks for what they want upon success as part of their funding proposal ask. I‚Äôll leave the ambiguity of ‚Äúsuccessful delivery‚Äù which is the 1 noun delivery criteria outside of this discussion.

To not be like your parents. To not be like your friends. To be yourself.\n\nCompletely.\n\nWhen I was young I had no sense of myself. All I was, was a product of all the fear and humiliation I suffered. Fear of my parents. The humiliation of teachers calling me ‚Äúgarbage can‚Äù and telling me I‚Äôd be mowing lawns for a living. And the very real terror of my fellow students. I was threatened and beaten up for the color of my skin and my size. I was skinny and clumsy, and when others would tease me I didn‚Äôt run home crying, wondering why.\n\nI knew all too well. I was there to be antagonized. In sports I was laughed at. A spaz. I was pretty good at boxing but only because the rage that filled my every waking moment made me wild and unpredictable. I fought with some strange fury. The other boys thought I was crazy.\n\nI hated myself all the time.\n\nAs stupid at it seems now, I wanted to talk like them, dress like them, carry myself with the ease of knowing that I wasn‚Äôt going to get pounded in the hallway between classes. Years passed and I learned to keep it all inside. I only talked to a few boys in my grade. Other losers. Some of them are to this day the greatest people I have ever known. Hang out with a guy who has had his head flushed down a toilet a few times, treat him with respect, and you‚Äôll find a faithful friend forever. But even with friends, school sucked. Teachers gave me hard time.\n\nI didn‚Äôt think much of them either.\n\nThen came Mr. Pepperman, my advisor. He was a powerfully built Vietnam veteran, and he was scary. No one ever talked out of turn in his class. Once one kid did and Mr. P. lifted him off the ground and pinned him to the black board. Mr. P. could see that I was in bad shape, and one Friday in October he asked me if I had ever worked out with weights. I told him no.\n\nHe told me that I was going to take some\nof the money that I had saved and buy a hundred pound set of weights at Sears. As I left his office, I started to think of things I would say to him on Monday when he asked about the weights that I was not going to buy. Still, it made me feel special. My father never really got that close to caring. On Saturday I bought the weights, but I couldn‚Äôt even drag them to my mom‚Äôs car. An attendant laughed at me as he put them on a dolly.\n\nMonday came and I was called into Mr. P.‚Äôs office after school. He said that he was going to show me how to work out. He was going to put me on a program and start hitting me in the solar plexus in the hallway when I wasn‚Äôt looking. When I could take the punch we would know that we were getting somewhere. At no time\nwas I to look at myself in the mirror or tell anyone at school what I was doing. In the gym he showed me ten basic exercises. I paid more attention than I ever did in any of my classes. I didn‚Äôt want to blow it. I went home that night and started right in.\n\nWeeks passed, and every once in a while Mr. P. would give me a shot and drop me in the hallway, sending my books flying. The other students didn‚Äôt know what to think. More weeks passed, and I was steadily adding new weights to the bar. I could sense the power inside my body growing. I could feel it.\n\nRight before Christmas break I was walking to class, and from out of nowhere Mr. Pepperman appeared and gave me a shot in the chest. I laughed and kept going. He said I could look at myself now. I got home and ran to the bathroom and pulled off my shirt. I saw a body, not just the shell that housed my stomach and my heart. My biceps bulged. My chest had definition. I felt strong. It was the first time I can remember having a sense of myself. I had done something and no one could ever take it away.\n\nYou couldn‚Äôt say s‚Äìt to me.\n\nIt took me years to fully appreciate the value of the lessons I have learned from the Iron. I used to think that it was my adversary, that I was trying to lift that which does not want to be lifted. I was wrong. When the Iron doesn‚Äôt want to come off the mat, it‚Äôs the kindest thing it can do for you. If it flew up and went through the ceiling, it wouldn‚Äôt teach you anything. That‚Äôs the way the Iron talks to you. It tells you that the material you work with is that which you will come to resemble.\n\nThat which you work against will always work against you.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt until my late twenties that I learned that by working out I had given myself a great gift. I learned that nothing good comes without work and a certain amount of pain. When I finish a set that leaves me shaking, I know more about myself. When something gets bad, I know it can‚Äôt be as bad as that workout.\n\nI used to fight the pain, but recently this became clear to me: pain is not my enemy; it is my call to greatness. But when dealing with the Iron, one must be careful to interpret the pain correctly. Most injuries involving the Iron come from ego. I once spent a few weeks lifting weight that my body wasn‚Äôt ready for and spent a few months not picking up anything heavier than a fork. Try to lift what you‚Äôre not prepared to and the Iron will teach you a little lesson in restraint and self-control.\n\nI have never met a truly strong person who didn‚Äôt have self-respect. I think a lot of inwardly and outwardly directed contempt passes itself off as self-respect: the idea of raising yourself by stepping on someone‚Äôs shoulders instead of doing it yourself. When I see guys working out for cosmetic reasons, I see vanity exposing them in the worst way, as cartoon characters, billboards for imbalance and insecurity. Strength reveals itself through character. It is the difference between bouncers who get off strong-arming people and Mr. Pepperman.\n\nMuscle mass does not always equal strength. Strength is kindness and sensitivity. Strength is understanding that your power is both physical and emotional. That it comes from the body and the mind. And the heart.\n\nYukio Mishima said that he could not entertain the idea of romance if he was not strong. Romance is such a strong and overwhelming passion, a weakened body cannot sustain it for long. I have some of my most romantic thoughts when I am with the Iron. Once I was in love with a woman. I thought about her the most when the pain from a workout was racing through my body.\n\nEverything in me wanted her. So much so that sex was only a fraction of my total desire. It was the single most intense love I have ever felt, but she lived far away and I didn‚Äôt see her very often. Working out was a healthy way of dealing with the loneliness. To this day, when I work out I usually listen to ballads.\n\nI prefer to work out alone.\n\nIt enables me to concentrate on the lessons that the Iron has for me. Learning about what you‚Äôre made of is always time well spent, and I have found no better teacher. The Iron had taught me\nhow to live. Life is capable of driving you out of your mind. The way it all comes down these days, it‚Äôs some kind of miracle if you‚Äôre not insane. People have become separated from their bodies. They are no longer whole.\n\nI see them move from their offices to their cars and on to their suburban homes. They stress out constantly, they lose sleep, they eat badly. And they behave badly. Their egos run wild; they become motivated by that which will eventually give them a massive stroke. They need the Iron Mind.\n\nThrough the years, I have combined meditation, action, and the Iron into a single strength. I believe that when the body is strong, the mind thinks strong thoughts. Time spent away from the Iron makes my mind degenerate. I wallow in a thick depression. My body shuts down my mind.\n\nThe Iron is the best antidepressant I have ever found. There is no better way to fight weakness than with strength. Once the mind and body have been awakened to their true potential, it‚Äôs impossible to turn back.\n\nThe Iron never lies to you. You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk, get told that you‚Äôre a god or a total bastard. The Iron will always kick you the real deal. The Iron is the great reference point, the all-knowing perspective giver. Always there like a beacon in the pitch black. I have found the Iron to be my greatest friend. It never freaks out on me, never runs. Friends may come and go. But two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds.", "proposal_id": "59", "casted_vote": "Against", "Sentiment Classification": "Positive", "Classification Tokens": 1997}

Also, we overall acknowledge that established artists and brands can be afforded a certain baseline of trust to execute on ideas. However, having said that, many Nouncillors expressed concern at the fact that the Proposal included no mockups or design plans, and no Development Phases tied to Milestones. We would like to see, even from established brands, at least some basic mockups to determine whether the designs will be desirable, and/or Nounish. And some Phase Breakdowns, maybe with a design consultation Phase to start, would have made this Proposal more amenable to more Nouncillors (we think.)

I'm voting AGAINST since I'm opposed to sending a signal to present and future nouns extensions that we value receiving NFT supply allocation in a special way.\n\nReceiving someone else's NFTs is kind of a headache. We're suddenly put into the position of having to make asset owner decisions (should we hold or sell) and in some cases such as this one we might have added governance responsibilities as well (e.g. have 10% responsibility of lil nouns' future). So unless we have some easy DAO level consensus on regularly selling the newly received NFTs, we're likely looking at the duties of holding onto an illiquid asset while incurring more DAO governance overhead. One might say that if we start receiving a lot of NFTs this way then some might really pop and have liquid markets and we might be able to experience some real ETH treasury gains through it. But if we really believed in that then we could have always bought new noun extension NFTs as pure investors with our ETH. I believe we have yet to do that because we don't think ourselves as NFT investors (even if the scope is limited to nouns extensions) and don't think that is where we create the most value from our attention. \n\nAn arrangement that we'd much rather prefer than being gifted NFT supply is a nouns extension buying Nouns with their treasury. In this arrangement, we get ETH and likely some governance participation as well, both things that we really like and no added responsibilities that we don't like. \n\nI'm not saying that we should be stingy or completely self centered in a short term way. I think Lil Nouns is a brilliant experiment and love that we're for example spinning up a lil nouns prop house and sending ETH their way to help bootstrap builders there, etc. I just think that rewarding NFT supply gifting over other acts such as buying nouns or participating in our governance (which both sharkdao and goop have done) sends the wrong message that is against our incentives. We want extensions to buy Nouns, submit proposals, and participate in our governance! Giving us assets for free can be nice but comparatively is meh.

This will be my testimony and my summation.\n\nJudge: Take the oath.\n\nCourt Clerk: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?\n\nRoark: I do.\n\nThousands of years ago, the first man discovered how to make fire. He was probably burned at the stake he had taught his brothers to light, but he left them a gift they had not conceived, and he lifted darkness off the earth.\n\nThroughout the centuries, there were men who took first steps down new roads, armed with nothing but their own vision. The great creators -- the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors -- stood alone against the men of their time. Every new thought was opposed; every new invention was denounced. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. They fought, they suffered, and they paid. But they won.\n\nNo creator was prompted by a desire to please his brothers. His brothers hated the gift he offered.\n\nHis truth was his only motive.\n\nHis work was his only goal.\n\nHis work -- not those who used it.\n\nHis creation -- not the benefits others derived from it -- the creation which gave form to his truth.\n\nHe held his truth above all things and against all men. He went ahead whether others agreed with him or not, with his integrity as his only banner. He served nothing and no one. He lived for himself. And only by living for himself was he able to achieve the things which are the glory of mankind. Such is the nature of achievement. Man cannot survive except through his mind. He comes on earth unarmed. His brain is his only weapon. But the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a collective brain. The man who thinks must think and act on his own. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsion. It cannot be subordinated to the needs, opinions, or wishes of others. It is not an object of sacrifice.\n\nThe creator stands on his own judgment; the parasite follows the opinions of others.\n\nThe creator thinks; the parasite copies.\n\nThe creator produces; the parasite loots.\n\nThe creator's concern is the conquest of nature; the parasite's concern is the conquest of men.\n\nThe creator requires independence. He neither serves nor rules. He deals with men by free exchange and voluntary choice.\n\nThe parasite seeks power. He wants to bind all men together in common action and common slavery. He claims that man is only a tool for the use of others -- that he must think as they think, act as they act, and live in selfless, joyless servitude to any need but his own.\n\nLook at history: Everything we have, every great achievement has come from the independent work of some independent mind. Every horror and destruction came from attempts to force men into a herd of brainless, soulless robots -- without personal rights, without person ambition, without will, hope, or dignity.\n\nIt is an ancient conflict. It has another name: \"The individual against the collective.\"\n\nOur country, the noblest country in the history of men, was based on the principle of individualism, the principle of man's \"inalienable rights.\" It was a country where a man was free to seek his own happiness, to gain and produce, not to give up and renounce; to prosper, not to starve; to achieve, not to plunder; to hold as his highest possession a sense of his personal value, and as his highest virtue his self-respect.\n\nLook at the results. That is what the collectivists are now asking you to destroy, as much of the earth has been destroyed.\n\nI am an architect. I know what is to come by the principle on which it is built. We are approaching a world in which I cannot permit myself to live. My ideas are my property. They were taken from me by force, by breach of contract. No appeal was left to me.\n\nIt was believed that my work belonged to others, to do with as they pleased. They had a claim upon me without my consent -- that it was my duty to serve them without choice or reward.\n\nNow you know why a dynamited Courtland. I designed Courtland. I made it possible. I destroyed it. I agreed to design it for the purpose of it seeing built as I wished. That was the price I set for my work. I was not paid. My building was disfigured at the whim of others who took all the benefits of my work and gave me nothing in return.\n\nI came here to say that I do not recognize anyone's right to one minute of my life, nor to any part of my energy, nor to any achievement of mine -- no matter who makes the claim!\n\nIt had to be said: The world is perishing from an orgy of self-sacrificing. I came here to be heard in the name of every man of independence still left in the world. I wanted to state my terms. I do not care to work or live on any others.\n\nMy terms are: A man's RIGHT to exist for his own sake.", "proposal_id": "130", "casted_vote": "For", "Sentiment Classification": "Positive", "Classification Tokens": 1143}

If you can‚Äôt get 2 Nouns then maybe not ready to go on-chain imho.\n\n**JoelCares**\nA 1 Noun threshold to submit proposals for the first 1000 Nouns feel reasonable to me.\n\n**andreitr**\nThe existing threshold is a feature that reduces noise.\n\n**fiveoceans_dev**\nI also, agree to keep the threshold growing. It will make smaller stake holders to work together and in turn help coordinate against potential malicious activities by individual big stake holders\n\n**kerimbonia**\nAlso in agreement that lowering the threshold will introduce more noise and with all the changes going on in the nouns ecosystem i'm not sure this is the best time for it.\n\n**mintface.eth**\nI lean towards a single Noun so that proposals get seen and evaluated. \n2 Nouns min creates a three party negotiation to take something on-chain. Two parties are then seen to 'endorse' or at a min be associated with proposer.\nThe idea of acquire a Noun and propose is cool.\n\n**CHEFFO ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\ni think that the current system is healthy and not needing a change\n\n**samellis ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®**\nDrop the threshold, good ideas will rise, especially with the changes of gas reimbursement and the more than likely time extension, why put an additional ‚Äúpay to play‚Äù barrier.

We don‚Äôt have a proposal spam problem yet (which is why this feature was baked in) so I think it makes sense to lower it to encourage more participation. Last time this was proposed (with a long time period attached that muddied the waters) it was all the brand new Nouners voting yes, which I think was telling. Keep in mind if spam ever became a problem, another proposal could easily raise the threshold again.\n\n**lil bk**\nall in favor of reducing the threshold to propose. entry of barrier to hold a noun is high as is. \n\nthere‚Äôs a total of 292 unique noun owners and thus don‚Äôt think spam would be an issue. instead, it‚Äôll increase the overall probability to proliferate/propose in the first place. if my counting is correct, there theoretically is only 58 people who can propose as it stands (holding 2 nouns)\n\n**kerimbonia**\ni'm on the fence with this one but starting to lean towards yes the more we chat about it. \ni def agree that anybody buying a noun should be able to put a proposal on-chain and that the cream of proposals will always rise to the top... that might sway my vote (no) concerning added noise to proposals and the additional time investment needed for voters/nouncil to discuss and filter through all of those to give each one the attention they deserve to get. i also think there is something very community about somebody with a noun having to reach out to another to get a proposal on-chain... anyways, still thinking about all this.", "proposal_id": "159", "casted_vote": "Against", "Sentiment Classification": "Neutral", "Classification Tokens": 873}

Builder currently has no metrics to match the size of this ask.\n\nThe Zora team should decide which approach to take.

Since winning that round (2 ETH), I have seen him work so hard to set up and roll out the .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®  network and identities that many of us love and use every day. \n\nHe has also reached out to every corner of the nouniverse to make sure .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® is natively resolved almost anywhere you want to interact, from nouns.wtf and Agora to basically any nounish auction site you can think of. \n\nHe built all this foundation nearly for free, almost seven months of blood, sweat and tears for a couple ETH.

Should we be more focus on spreading the meme beyond the DAO? Can we avoid a distribution that favors those who hold several Nouns? \n\nI am sympathetic these concerns and appreciate those who have raised them, but I am still for this proposal. Proposal 57, which funded the creation of 8,250 of these glasses, included an allotment of 500 glasses to NounsDAO itself. I consider 50‚Äî10%‚Äîto be a fairly modest portion of this allotment. I think giving them to DAO members is a fun use and a very reasonable way to ‚Äúspread the meme:‚Äù I think we should have some faith that the Nouners who receive these will do interesting things with them! \n\n150 have already been given elsewhere and after this 300 will remain.

The cost isn't particularly high.\n-This will return ETH no matter what, so the ETH cost is less than 102 stated.\n-Andre is real and it's a thoughtful plan even given concerns that can be raised.  Will be on them to deliver and execute in Year 3, not just Year \n\n0.\n-I will absolutely buy this product and probably know a bunch of people who would, so there's PMF.\n-The NFT angle with the branded product is a good one, has life and adds legs.  Owning a barrel over time is an experiential good, and something \n\nyou can do with a group of friends.\n-Plays with commitments and ventures over longer time frames than most DAOs do or would.

It went ok but it hasn't left our bubble yet and the community around it is pre-traction.  As a platform, it's very early and doesn't exist yet.  It doesn't warrant big spending (yet), it's still very much at the experiment level.  It's on this team to prove out much more before it's worth funding more.  It doesn't make sense for the DAO to take experiments and 5x or 10x the funding unless there's strong evidence that it was a clear win.  If this was \"continue to explore Noun Sounds\" and 50 ETH +  20 ETh for a CC0 music Prop House rounds, there'd be something to debate, but after this ask and the strategy, I'd lean No there.\n\nThere is serious issues here with strategy and not understanding that the partnerships with these famous musicians are not only very expensive marketing for a platform that isn't ready for it but also a poor fit for how to build a real organic CC0 focused music community of any kind.  You need people, small people, passionate people who vibe organically and don't need to be paid to vibe.  Find those people, engage them with Noun Sounds, build Noun Sounds and its community with them.  Money doesn't spend for that.\n\nWhen Proposers are getting paid by the DAO in other places, it's helpful and important to lay that out upfront.  The DAO deserves to know, the relationship is already so assymetrical, I expect our partners to be clear and WANT the DAO to be informed.  \n\nI'd also want to see Proposals be transparent when they have relationships with entities they are funding in the Proposal itself.  It would help to know that Woody has a relationship with Save the Music -- it means that execution there is more likely to go more smoothly.  It's also important because the DAO should know when there's the potential for related party transactions. It's small dollars here so it doesn't matter as much right now but STM was also was mentioned in that this team expects funding for future STM proposals, so understanding that relationship is important.  It also highlights the lack of cohesion and focus here -- STM future proposals for even more money but also focusing on expensive celebrity marketing but also working on a pre-traction platform that will live and die by passionate CC0 creators that are not either of the first 2 groups is an odd admixture.", "proposal_id": "225", "casted_vote": "Against", "Sentiment Classification": "Neutral", "Classification Tokens": 553}

But if we knew we had to buy 30k comics for $150k then, it's possible the DAO would have voted differently given this would have increased the all-in cost by 50%.\n\nAs is, the evidence that there is demand for 30k comics isn't easily observable.  Why 5k and not 2k per issue?  After the original proposal was off, need more clarity and confidence to double down and buy our own comic.  Nounders voted No to a 10k toy run for Nounish Friends with unique composable figures by Klim and the rationale was that these would sit in a warehouse and that was cheaper than the comics proposal all-in.  How is there 3x demand for this at a higher cost to the DAO?\n\nAt $5/comic, that feels like we are paying retail prices for a wholesale relationship.  The explanation provided doesn't square for me.  We are bearing the full risk with no upside. There are live sites right now to buy these comics $3.5-4 at retail.  It's a discrepancy that stands out.\n\nIf this is needed to be effective at Comicon(s) or to issue well, it should have been brought to the DAO before the last minute end of their February deadline.  Being rushed is suboptimal.\n\nI was a Yes vote until reconsidering now based on leadership that unpersuaded me based on its value destructive approach and made me dig in more.

Although Nouns.Center has implemented this feature, its entry point is too deep, and no one uses it. These are the reasons why we do not believe PropLot will be successfully adopted in NounsDAO.\n\n2. There are also many alternative products available.

This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the ‚Äúsquad vote‚Äù result for proposal 241, which is 33 for, 8 against and 15 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.\n\nThe House Of Nouns proposal is one that is difficult to find flaws in.\n\nWe have two concerns:\n\n1. NounsDAO has no ownership of the product that the proposal promises. Will the ownership of the product, as promised in the proposal, be allocated to NounsDAO? If there is no correlation, then the funds requested in the proposal are essentially for the team to develop a product that belongs solely to themselves using NounsDAO's funds. This is a proposal that harms Nouns and benefits the team.\n\n2. Complexity of features. The product promises to implement a complete governance lifecycle, including collecting ideas, early-stage discussions, on-chain decisions, etc. This means that the functional requirements are complex, and once the complexity is identified, even the best product manager will find it difficult to handle.\n\nFirst concern is not an issue with the 242 proposal, but rather with the immaturity of the NounsDAO system itself.\n\nOverall, we like the House Of Nouns product and team for the following reasons:\n\n1. We are frequent users of House Of Nouns. It is simple and has redesigned the user interaction logic to focus on proposals, rather than channels, communities, or governance participants. This is a new type of product, and it has been well received by users (we can attest to that).\n\n2. House Of Nouns is the first governance tool to define a complete governance process, implying a standard for proposal governance. It is beneficial not only for NounsDAO but also for the Nounish and Crypto industry, as it promotes scientific and standardized governance.\n\n3. House Of Nouns has an excellent product team behind it. They understand the Nouns spirit and have developed a new Nouns model product called thatsgnarly.ly. Behind House Of Nouns and ThatsGnarly's products, one can see a professional and continuous product development system, which is invaluable.", "proposal_id": "242", "casted_vote": "Abstain", "Sentiment Classification": "Neutral", "Classification Tokens": 572}

Nouns should focus on storytelling and creating memes  instead of high-quality.\n2. Proposal 195 video fails to demonstrate the team's storytelling ability. There are no memes or compelling stories, and there is no motivation for secondary creation and propagation. The video has only received 86 shares, 166 likes, and 40,000 views. Moreover, the TikTok link on Zora is invalid. The video appears soulless with exquisite 3D models but a flat and bland story.\n3. Nouns Town in Proposal 195 has no Nouns elements.

Refuse to change the constitutional-level rules of the DAO without evidence that Rage Quit is effective (MolochDAO rarely uses Rage Quit) or sufficient community debate. Proposals of this level require lengthy debate, repeated proposals and opposition, and then approval. Changing the underlying rules lightly is irresponsible to the consensus. It is normal for a system to have human flaws at every level. However, a casual attitude towards underlying rules could destroy the Nouns system, a stable system is better than no system.\n2. NounsDAO already has a secondary market exit method. Rage Quit is a term that appears powerful on the surface, but in essence, it is a bad price market-making way. It does not have the game-theoretical effect it promises.\n3. The importance behind Rage Quit is not angry, but forking. The execution of this proposal did not enhance the system or generate more viable branches, but resulted in a loss of consensus, which is negative on the margin. Instead, leaving feedback for continuous improvement of the system can turn it into a way to enhance the system. The efficiency of Nouns proposal supervision has also been improving and will continue to progress.\n4. The proposal implies that everyone is angry, which is a language game. The fact is that most users have a mixed feeling of disappointment and hope. Any one-sided release of hope or anger will damage a system.\n5. Earlier proposal 192 had a more comprehensive rage quit design called theDAO Split mechanism/design. The proposer, Verbs team, pointed out that although it is still under discussion with legal counsel, they believe it is the best solution for Nouns. They are now soliciting community opinions and think it is very urgent to implement it as soon as possible.\n\nThe supporting viewpoints for this proposal are very simple:\n1.

We‚Äôve decided to vote against Nouns Prop 248. \n\nA key risk is that rage quit risks a stifling of treasury funds. Each treasury activation / funding grant would at least temporarily lower the book value of Nouns, so holders are faced with a trade-off every time they vote on a proposal: fund the prop vs. preserve the book value of their Noun. In theory, this creates a forcing function for better evaluating the merits of each prop ‚Äì only props which are believed to drive future value to the DAO in excess of the current book value of each Noun would pass. In practice, that‚Äôs hard to quantify proactively. The consequence could be fewer funding approvals, especially for more provocative experiments that may not have as explicit financial returns. \n\nWe recognize that, even if this proposal is defeated, it‚Äôs likely not the last time we‚Äôll see a rage quit proposal submitted to the Nouns DAO. In light of this, it‚Äôs worth taking a moment to revisit some of what makes Nouns special:\n\n\nThe ability to activate funds for bold, unique experiments in brand and community building\nHighly engaged community members\nA consistent source of funding (the daily auction)\n\nAny implementation of rage quit should seek to preserve those core primitives. 4156 has already proposed one alternative mechanism, whereby any Nouner who votes but lands in the minority on a proposal can rage quit as a sign of their dissent. This version would help encourage continued community engagement (by making voting a prerequisite to rage quitting), while preserving the ability of the community to access funding for projects. There may be other versions that preserve and protect the values of Nouns as well. We‚Äôre committed to evaluating each proposal on its individual merits. But today the version in question is what‚Äôs proposed in Prop 248, and we‚Äôre voting no.

The finances for marketing proposals should be tightened. It is recommended that all marketing proposals go through the Small Grant channel. If they want to go through the on-chain major proposal channel, they must prove that there can be revenue and feedback to the treasury. The key indicator for evaluating a marketing proposal is whether or not it has a meme or story. The idea behind this proposal is obvious and lacks any story or meme.\n2. Based on my current experience, I have observed that Nouns attract new community members and grow primarily through outstanding community products, the hard work of dedicated teams, the tireless promotion of Nouns by holders, and prop house rounds that demonstrate Noun's vigorous vitality of the community. However, Proposal 251 has created a Consumerism landscape that is not conducive to marketing and brand building within the community.Personally, I have no interest in marketing without incorporating memes or stories. Proposal 251 will not capture the recognition of both fashion circles and Crypto-Native partners, and instead make them feel like there is another naive buyer paying for trendy things while satisfying some people's self-perceived pleasure in effective marketing.\n3. Data shows that Proposal 197 had poor execution results after implementation with only one thousand views on Twitter review proposals with sixteen retweets compared to an investment of $120k resulting in low ROI.\n\nOpinions supporting this proposal:\n1. 3D printed fashion looks good and novel.\n2.

The theme of Hack Week is not clear, and the proposal is a bit rough.\n2. Time.

It's unreasonable to hastily organize a Nouns ecosystem Hack Week for about $200,000.\n\nSupporting views on the proposal:\n1. A replicable growth model has been proven in the Nouns ecosystem. From Open Round and private voting research rounds, this is the best Nouns growth model. And every launch will attract enough attention and increase community cohesion. This proposal belongs to repeating an already successful model to promote ecological growth for Nouns with no logical problems.\n2. The difference in this proposal is that Hack Week will involve more operational work than Prop House rounds without promotion or operation; this replicable model can actually be optimized by Proposal 253 for mature growth within Nouns' ecosystem.\n3. Behind Proposal 253 are teams such as Nouns.build, Nouns Square, Grant Protocol etc., who together form a golden team among all proposals related to nouns - they are trustworthy due to their understanding of noun spirits as well as professionalism and execution capabilities.\n4.

How to make this into a repeatable Open Franchise kit, with the Nouns cc0 meme, open to all, such that any independent restauranter can plug into it and use aspects of it as they see fit (or not, open means use what works or nothing at all), and each one that plugs in enhances the entire network and its reach and relevance, a decentralized cc0 branded franchise. There are other elements to this stack that can be added by smart builders if they see an opportunity from loyalty/marketing/retention/rewards program/Web3 Point of Sale UX are all natural fits and some will be made in this Proposal but this model and kit will be open and evolve and incorporate what works and drop what doesn't over time.\n\nDone well this Open Franchise Model mutually reinforces Nouns and whichever restaurants plug into it.  It could empower independent retail food service and create many proliferation opportunities that shoot off in a bunch of directions from customers to existing restaurants to people who are engaged by disruptive never before tried models.  This experiment has the potential to blaze this trail.  It will be on the team, who bring a track record running similar restaurants and businesses and who own Nouns and are committed to Nouns and are going out on a limb, to make this happen and create a model Nouns franchise.  This Proposal and the Nouns seed relationship and halo is what give it the chance to grow.\n\nAs to protections for the DAO, the cost side is what it costs to take this risk, we went back and forth on it.  Nothing seems out of whack or inflated, they are making disruptive changes to an existing business and its physical plant to effect this change. There are milestones in place from within the multisig controlled by Nouners so there's also controls if it runs into an insurmountable challenge and has to stop.

The proposal emphasizes business model innovation, but using a points program to maintain user loyalty without any community ownership does not reflect innovative business models. Existing Web3 consumer explorations have shown that even if the community has a little bit of ownership, the effect will be very different.\n2. The biggest concern is sustainability. Some long-standing old stores root themselves in the community and condense rich social relationships. However, operators in this proposal rely more on Nouns12 to maintain it. If people who have been in restaurants for a long time do not see or understand information about Nouns belonging to the community, then the relationship between such restaurants and Nouns is very fragile over time. In other words, if operators of the Nouns brand do not love their community, its actual effect on Nouns' culture and brand will be minimal.\n3. I asked about restaurant ownership issues with Nouns12, and they replied that there was no connection between restaurant ownership and Nouns; it only had promotional effects on branding. From this perspective, it's not cost-effective.\n4. We are unfamiliar with Australia's commercial environment and concerned about instability in offline space operations - such as local restaurant closure rates or whether it's possible to spend $200k decorating an establishment only for it to become unprofitable after one year.\n\nSupporting views on the proposal:\n1. I've always had special feelings towards physical spaces offline. Buildings are not just functional venues but also condensed things within meaning worlds that remain unchanged. Building a square in a community where social interactions occur frequently - like children playing around or lovers being intimate - remains constant while producing many interesting stories above them; layered cultures emerge from these buildings over time.Building architecture is unique because promoting culture is difficult yet when an offline entity exists long enough; interesting stories continue emerging from them creating multi-layered cultures.\n2. Despite having several problems highlighted by opposing views regarding short-term benefits versus costs involved with this proposal, it's worth exploring and seeking Co-Create's consultation and assistance. This proposal takes an important step in Nouns' exploration of Web3+ consumption + offline community building, even if the concept may not be perfect.", "proposal_id": "254", "casted_vote": "Abstain", "Sentiment Classification": "Neutral", "Classification Tokens": 628}

This proposal follows the traditional brand operation mindset of funding special groups and shaping their own brand image. Now NounsDAO funds an inspirational star who knows nothing about Nouns and has done nothing for Nouns, implanting a positive and optimistic brand spirit in everyone, which is an extremely rigid and inflexible brand strategy that does not fit with Nouns.\nNoun's brand is a completely different model from previous brands; it is a headless brand where people feel the project's branding characteristics from community members' experiences. For the branding of Nouns, vivid stories or creatively concise memes should be used to enhance culture and build community consensus rather than funding a celebrity who has no understanding of Nouns.

The past three Nouns Fairs seemed to prioritize creating a lively atmosphere more than genuinely onboarding builders, and they did not showcase Nounish ideas and products born at hackathons (perhaps it's not apparent yet, as some builders might not have built products on the spot but developed ideas later).\n2. Financial details are excessively indulgent: (1) the average cost of each fair is $38,438, while the bounty for rewarding builders is only $5,000, accounting for 13%, with the rest considered as marketing costs; there is too much budget allocation for marketing surrounding the Hackthon; (2) after three iterations, some aspects could be standardized and streamlined to avoid reinventing the wheel, such as reusing materials, resulting in instances of financial waste; (3) the costs for each event vary, but in planning, each is set the same; if the funds are not fully used, will they be returned to the treasury?\n3. Data does not meet expected plans. The organizer's initial goal was 1,000 Twitter followers, but after the first event, the actual number was 580. After hosting three events, Nouns Amigos currently has 1,200 followers, with the growth rate gradually decreasing and an average of 300 new followers per event.\n4. In Proposal 180, the team pledged to save funds, with excess funds to be returned to NounsDAO. However, this statement is removed in the current proposal, and after 36 hours of inquiring on Discord, there has still been no response. The team has made some changes in the crucial details of the proposal's financial aspect. It makes me feel that the team deliberately doesn't want to clarify the issue of financial waste, and I am concerned about whether the team might obtain undue benefits from the implementation.\n\nSupporting views on the proposal:\n1. The issue is not whether the proposal should be implemented, but rather its cost-effectiveness. Raising Nouns' influence at Ethglobal IRL hackthons is something that should be done, with cost-effectiveness being a secondary concern.\n2. The team can establish a professional Web3 event standard operating procedure (SOP).\n3. The team has a track record of three successful events. The current Twitter followers are 1,000+. The average cost per follower is $50,000/1,000, or $50 per user. The data performance is at least average.\n\nPoints of uncertainty include:\n1. I have not been to ETHGlobal in Mexico, Bogota, or San Francisco, so I cannot understand the local atmosphere. Moreover, the most important aspect of offline marketing proposals is the specific implementation by the two members; we need to hear firsthand opinions from those who have interacted with them. \n2. Although team have been able to execute events in the past, the team seems to have abandoned many original principles and become increasingly wasteful in the proposal, which makes me cautious.\n3. NounsDAO proposals may exhibit a pattern of gradual governance attack. This starts with a few Small Grant deliveries, then bundles what should have been several small proposals into one large proposal, delivering low-quality results and pocketing the funds in between. This is an issue with the NounsDAO system. The NounsDAO system is imperfect, lacking supervision and feedback for long-term large proposals, as well as continuous incentives, potentially causing good actors to turn bad. Could Proposal 257 be an example of this gradual governance attack pattern? How can we solve this problem?\n4. There are many conflicting thoughts regarding NounsDAO's financial scrutiny:\n4.1 I believe that strict financial control will not yield good results, as financial systems need a mature community culture and relevant modules. Insisting on stringent requirements for any financial aspect in the absence of a solid foundation will do more harm than good to the system.\n4.2 I think a 30% premium above the market rate is acceptable. Extra profit will make proposal deliveries more standardized and sustainable, reducing the sense of confusion and uncertainty for the implementing members on the cutting edge.\n4.3 I can also understand the strict financial stance is resonable; if there is a 70% reduction in financial advocacy, then a 30% reduction in the financial budget may also be acceptable to the community. We should stick to strict financial discipline.", "proposal_id": "257", "casted_vote": "Abstain", "Sentiment Classification": "Neutral", "Classification Tokens": 1076}

In this world, we would have no need for rules or principles. But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a ‚ÄúSquad Vote‚Äù for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the ‚Äúsquad vote‚Äù result for proposal 258, which is 0 for, 30 against and 0 abstain, we choose to vote against.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):\n\nOpinions opposing this proposal:\n1. This is not community building. It's merely Satori and Bixbite doing business with Nouns, a business that is not advantageous for Nouns.\n2. Satori and Bixbite's remarks in the Jungle channel, such as \"Lil Nouns is cheap so I gave them a cheap\" and \"Lil Nouns is a toxic environment,\" further convince me that they do not understand the spirit of the community. They display arrogance toward the individual community members, treating DAOs and communities as cold numbers. This is the worst and most repulsive proposal and proposers I have encountered.\n3. NounsDAO needs to operate in a community-driven manner, incubating more teams that understand and love the Nounish spirit. Today, NounsDAO has many teams that both love Nouns and can produce outstanding work. Yet, W3BSTOCK only seeks to be an outsourcing team, proposing a disadvantageous business deal.\n4. I will continue to oppose such activities that use exposure as a gimmick. The traditional growth model that relies on increased exposure is effective because it has a unified company and growth system behind it. However, the conversion rate of each aspect of this growth method would plummet in NounsDAO, rendering it ineffective. NounsDAO's growth engine comes from numerous small teams that love Nouns and have comprehensive capabilities, as well as the establishment of specific social relationships.\n5. Nouns may no longer need this type of exposure.\n\nSupporting views on the proposal:\n1. A dedicated event organizer possesses sufficient professionalism.\n2. They have participated in the Lilnouns community and observed the Nouns community. Although they mayn't to adapt, they have their own understanding of decentralized governance issues.\n\nPoints of uncertainty include:\n1. Bitcoin has never rejected anyone. Conflicts between native and external teams can be observed in various projects. On one hand, I have seen cases where bringing in professionals to solve problems for projects ended poorly. Native teams must build every module from scratch, and there are no shortcuts. On the other hand, the MakerDAO model shows that, despite severe conflicts between native and external teams, they are not mutually exclusive at the protocol level. Instead, they should be embraced by the protocol.", "proposal_id": "258", "casted_vote": "Against", "Sentiment Classification": "Neutral", "Classification Tokens": 655}

If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.\n\nAccording to the ‚Äúsquad vote‚Äù result for proposal 263, which is 13 for, 14 against and 19 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):\n\nProposal 263 has presented us with a conundrum, making it difficult for us to render judgment. The Nouns Protector has just been established, and it may take approximately six months for clarifying our principles. We will briefly summarize the debates from our meeting:\n\nNouns Esports has accomplished laudable outcomes, genuinely creating a stable organization to underpin esports teams' operations. This initial step is laden with myriad challenges that remain beyond our imagine. And, they have admirably maintained fiscal transparency throughout the process.\n\nDespite their successes, the community has voiced concerns about the long-term viability of Nouns Esports as a business. Should Nouns Esports evolve into an entity that perpetually depletes NounsDAO's cash flow, depending on ceaseless transfusions from NounsDAO for sustenance, this model would not be sustainable for NounsDAO in the long run.\n\nFurthermore, NounsDAO ought to concentrate on cultivating a more diverse and populous community. Some members posit that:\n\n\"\nNouns should channel resources into domains where it possesses an unambiguous competitive edge. Esports is not a realm where NounsDAO holds a competitive advantage. The Matthew effect is conspicuous within esports events, with elite teams monopolizing the lion's share of attention and securing funding that far exceeds $800,000. This sector is fiercely competitive. Nouns Esports cannot amass a competitive cache of funds, which means they cannot engage top-tier players nor establish a premier support infrastructure. Consequently, they will only gain exposure in regional championships and open tournaments (as evidenced by their historical performance), unable to penetrate truly valuable core events.\nWhat merit is there in allocating excessive funds to a sphere where NounsDAO can only assume a secondary role, particularly for an organization in its nascent stages, with a community treasury of a mere $50 million?\n\"\n\n\"\nMore effective use of funds could be achieved by allocating 700 ETH to incubate 10 vibrant subculture DAOs across diverse fields, rather than expending a relatively negligible amount of funding to compete in conventional events.\n\"\n\nMoreover, cautionary reminders have been raised about the pervasiveness of intimate personal relationships within NounsDAO:\n\n\"\nProposals prior to Proposal 200 have made considerable contributions to NounsDAO's present public image and clout. However, it has also engendered a nexus of relationships, with many decisions swayed by personal connections and predispositions.\nIf NounsDAO is to pivot towards a more lucid, native, and 'truly growth' trajectory‚Äîchampioning a broader array of NounishDAOs‚Äîthe community networks forged during the preceding strategic round may serve as impediments. As a result, more resources may be funneled towards politically correct but inefficacious marketing proposals, suppressing the potential for vibrant but peripheral creators to enter the Nouns ecosystem.\n\"\n\nNotwithstanding any criticisms, Nouns Esports remains an outstanding member of NounishDAO. Additionally, esports represents an excellent conduit for Nouns to interface with the external world.

On top of that, they are receiving all the proceeds from the NFT sales. Seems we are double spending here. This needs to be further clarified. \nAlso, it would've been great to see a % of the sales being returned back to the treasury.\n\nSecondly, I would have liked to see more on proliferation.

My analysis of funding requests is:\n1. Is this a public good?\n2. Is this public good something that other organizations won‚Äôt fund, or that Nouns is uniquely best to fund?\n\nWriting about the Nouniverse is not necessarily a public good, but public domain writing about Nouns is. Public domain writing, just like CC0 art or freely licensed code, is composable. While the ways it could be remixed may be less obvious, it's equally important as other forms of composable creative work. \n\nMy other lens is whether this is something that other organizations won't fund. There are many established pathways to funding books, even if they are admittedly hard to access. Nouns is also not uniquely suited to funding novels. But at the same time, these established pathways are less accessible for public domain works, which the proposal points out forgoes revenue opportunities. (That is why many books choose CC BY-NC-SA as their license, to ensure that the work is able to be shared freely by readers but not used commercially).\n\nThe concerns that other voters brought up around the size of the ask and the fact that there are other established pathways for funding books are valid. At the same time, public domain composability for books is an important experiment. While I don't yet know what composability will result from this book, I believe that it's a good experiment for Nouns. I am in support of this proposal, but would be more hesitant to vote for similar proposals until we see how the benefits of public domain composability play out for Nouns-related books.\n\n(I would also note that I did read both chapters in full prior to making a decision, and I quite liked them.

We‚Äôve decided to vote against Prop 271.\n\nOur rationale stems from a mix of concerns regarding alignment with the broader goal of NounsDAO, the effectiveness of propagating the Nouns meme, and the justification of the cost of the proposal.\n\nOne of the things that excited us most about joining NounsDAO was its mission of funding public goods and the self-sustaining mechanism it invented to continue to do so. A middle-grade novel strikes us as distinct from more powerful public goods initiatives we‚Äôve seen, like cleaning up trash in Africa or funding the planting of trees. We‚Äôd love to see Nouns devoting funding toward bigger, more ambitious projects.\n\nSecond, the proposal contains no plans for distribution of the novel. Key to Nouns‚Äô mission is propagating the meme. Creation of content is important, but the true execution is in distribution. Even if we imagine that the novel achieves moderate success, the distribution will be most potent among children (likely 7-10 year-olds, i.e. the ones who read the novel). In our view, that‚Äôs not the target audience for Nouns; the funding mechanism only works if people feel compelled to buy into the community, and creating emotional ties with children may struggle to fulfill the Nouns flywheel (auction funds Treasury ‚Üí Treasury funds projects ‚Üí projects increase demand for the auction ‚Üí and so on) in the short-medium term.  \n\nThird, 25 ETH for this proposal feels expensive, at least with the justification for funds given in the prop. To date, we have tried to avoid debates on the cost of funding associated with proposals, given a key component of Nouns is the ability to easily unlock funding for unique and attention-grabbing experiments. 25 ETH without any plans for exogenous distribution ‚Äì and simply a plan to release a timed open edition (where demand for the mint will likely be endogenous from the Nouns community) ‚Äì seems a potentially ineffective use of funds. That‚Äôs not to say there may not be a strong justification for 25 ETH without a go-to-market plan; rather, we simply did not see one in the proposal. A more effective request, for instance, would have included detail about market comps for the cost of publication to better benchmark a reasonable expected cost. \n\nThe reason we feel compelled to mention funding here is because we want to prevent the setting of a precedent in which the Nouns Treasury is seen as a free money machine. Funding should be easily accessible, but should match the boldness or proliferation expected with each proposal.\n\nOne thing of note is that the creator feels part of the 25 ETH is necessary to compensate them for forgoing future revenue streams; in other words, the upfront payment covers for the lack of a longer-term stake in the success of the novel. To us, this suggests there may be a better way than pure ETH grants to reward creators for contributing to the community: find a way to give them a stake in the success of Nouns. We‚Äôve been exploring ideas related to this challenge in incentive alignment, and hope to have additional ideas to share with the community soon.\n\nAnd finally, we‚Äôre still excited by this proposal and appreciate the author‚Äôs hard work. We encourage the author to resubmit a proposal, with a revised plan for funding and/or more detail on distribution for the project.\n", "proposal_id": "271", "casted_vote": "Against", "Sentiment Classification": "Neutral", "Classification Tokens": 747}

Once a project is viewed as canonical, it will be hard to dislodge. Nouns should have a healthy ecosystem where projects naturally form and die. This allows contributors to step up, and just as importantly allows contributors to move on.\n\nMuch of this perspective is influenced by the Loot community, where projects viewed as ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù had significantly more sway among users than equivalent projects that were not viewed as ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù. If Nouns begins to bless certain projects with a canonical namespace, it will take energy away from non-canonical projects.\n\nOne simple hypothetical: What if Agora had a canonical namespace at nouns.agora.eth but House of Nouns did not? Is Agora now more ‚Äúofficial‚Äù than House of Nouns? Should we bless more projects with official namespaces, to put them on a level playing field?

It is something that benefits the entire ecosystem, and it is something that many groups won‚Äôt fund. This funding is especially powerful coming from a more neutral organization like Nouns. Advocacy from VC funds and companies is excellent and their work is incredibly important, but Nouns serves a special role by decoupling its advocacy from direct financial interests. This advocacy also benefits Nouns and other DAOs, which lack significant amounts of regulatory clarity.\n\nI understand concerns by Scott and others that regulatory advocacy is off-mission (https://twitter.com/scott_lew_is/status/1652699651265503233). Those concerns are thoughtful, and I agree that Nouns is not and should not be an advocacy organization for regulatory change. At the same time, I draw a strong distinction between funding advocacy and directly participating in advocacy. Funding advocacy in my mind is on-mission as a public good, but participating in advocacy is likely something that the existing advocacy groups can do far better than Nouns. As long as Nouns sticks to funding only, advocacy can be an effective public good.\n\nThat being said, I wish this proposal was stronger in its advocacy for Nouns PR. In my opinion, Nouns is not aggressive enough in advertising its donations, and that hinders it from attracting people and acting as a beacon for public goods. Claiming the top spot on the leaderboard is a good start, but I wish the proposal went further on advocating for Nouns publicity. A few things that I wish were addressed in the proposal:\n1. Nouns would be putting up 50% of the funding for the crypto advocacy round (Coinbase put up the other $100K, with the rest being direct donations from users), but the description on the Gitcoin Grants Round only states that  ‚ÄúCoinbase is on a mission to advocate for digital asset policies here in the United States, and this crypto advocacy round will support the amazing organizations who are leading the charge.‚Äù I would love a commitment from Coinbase and/or Gitcoin to include Nouns in the description of the advocacy round if this proposal passes. Coinbase, Gitcoin, and Nouns are stronger together! This is a collaboration I‚Äôd love to see.\n2. I wish that Nouns had suggestions on how the advocacy organizations that will benefit from the matching funds could collaborate with Nouns. These don‚Äôt need to be requirements, merely suggestions. For example, welcoming advocacy organizations and their members to participate in the Nouns Playground and set a Nouns from the Playground as their PFP would set a nice norm, whether or not those groups choose to adopt it. (I also recognize that in this case, the amount is on the smaller side for that kind of PR.)\n3. The history of the Shield emoji and Coinbase is something that I wish the proposal clearly discussed. It‚Äôs worth noting that the Shield emoji is repurposed from the ‚ÄúCoinbase FUD protection squad‚Äù (https://twitter.com/lay2000lbs/status/1551956224232628224) and was previously used by Coinbase employees and supporters to signal support for Coinbase as a company. While there are only so many shield emoji available, it is relevant for Nouns voters to know that they‚Äôre participating in an initiative that is repurposing symbols that supported Coinbase as symbols to support the industry. I am perfectly fine with this, but the history is relevant as Nouns thinks about how much it benefits from branding here.\n\nIn short, while Nouns could do more to advocate for itself and get stronger PR benefits from this, I am in support of this proposal. Funding regulatory advocacy is a public good that benefits the ecosystem, and I believe it matches Nouns‚Äôs mission as long as Nouns sticks to funding only.", "proposal_id": "278", "casted_vote": "For", "Sentiment Classification": "Neutral", "Classification Tokens": 878}

Is this a public good?\n2. Is this public good something that other organizations won‚Äôt fund, or that Nouns is uniquely best to fund?\n\nThis proposal wants to build a sustainable, profitable business. Which is excellent! But it‚Äôs not building a public good. Likewise, there are many outlets for funding CPG branding plays, though they do often require some upfront capital.\n\nThis proposal also feels like a ‚Äúproliferate the meme‚Äù type of proposal, which is fun and interesting, but doesn‚Äôt serve public goods.\n\nFor this reason, I was tempted to vote Against. At the same time, as I was analyzing this proposal, I began to think of all of the ways this brand could serve public goods-oreineted goals.\n\nThe design contest is an obvious starting point. Inviting artists to participate, and ideally having commissions or a portion of the profits flow back to them, is one way. The community contributions are strong here, showing that this brand is already acting as a gathering place.\n\nIt could also help other groups bootstrap knowledge in building CPG brands. Ideally, the team could aid other groups wanting to launch Nouns-related CPG projects. In the long run, fewer of these projects would need to be funded by the DAO and could instead be funded by an ecosystem of self-sustaining CPG brands.\n\nFor this reason, my inclination is to say yes to experimentation. I‚Äôd want to wait and see how this plays out before approving similar props. Does this end up as a community driven CPG initiative? If so, amazing! Does this continue forever as a self-sustaining wet wipes business business? A wonderful thing, but probably something that should have been funded by other venues.

I can put it in videos, art, put it on a shirt. The more this focuses on CC0 media the more it enables and encourages viral permissionless growth of Nouns.\n\n2. The Nouns DAO on-chain proposals section needs to be fleshed out more, and could also be a serious justification for this project. Each funded DAO proposal should have a ton of meta-media. Behind the scenes shots, interviews with the proposer, images from the on-chain prop, screenshots and screen recordings of anything digital. Currently most props have 1-4 images and it doesn't feel comprehensive. Work with the prop submitters and teams to really get a thorough pile of media from them.\n\n3. Better top-level organization of content. I don't really understand the difference between NOUNS SPECIAL and NOUNS WORLD and NOUNS on the front page - it should be way more intuitive. Each item on the front page needs to be essential and obvious.\n\n4. This prop is probably too focused on the design and tech.

Are there any huge pain points we can solve since we'll be going 0 to 1?
