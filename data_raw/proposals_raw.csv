As the first test of Nouns DAO governance and to demonstrate to the community how the ecosystem works, we will donate 5 ETH each to 6 charities. With the exception of Coral Restoration Foundation and GiveCrypto, these charities were chosen because they have publicly available Ethereum donation addresses.
Coral Restoration Foundation was recommended by SharkDAO and their representative Goldy.mov generated an address on the charity's site. GiveCrypto was recommended by 4156 and he generated an address on the charity's site.

2,3D Nouns Generator,"# 3D Nouns Generator
## Origin of the Project
This idea is the natural continuation of experiments that I made while watching the Nouns project emerge in the very first weeks. Early on, it appeared to me that these 32*32 characters would make great voxel models and could potentially be turned into 3D avatars for the metaverse. I kept making those models and posting them on Twitter as animated GIFs.
## What Is It?
Similar to the Nouns playground, we would like to build a web app to let users create and download custom 3D Nouns. Users could pick attributes or leave the drop down to random (default value).

Think of the « build your character » screen at the beginning of a game. You compose your Noun, and can test a few animations on your build, like ""walk"", ""run"", or ""dance"". Once you are done, there is a download button that outputs a textured and rigged GLTF file.

This extends the ecosystem beyond 2D into the 3D world and allows for animations, games, renders and more to be built using those prefabs. It opens a world of possibilities for the nouns ecosystem and will result in more derivatives and more memes over time.
## Project Ethos
The project will be open sourced under GNU GPLv3 and all the 3D art will be available to download and use via the interface. We will share the code on Github once the project is completed. Our goal is to encourage artists and engineers to build on top of this and extend the Noun ecosystem.
## Scope of the Project
In order to complete a working version of that site, we need:
1. All project assets modeled in 3D:
* 236 heads
* 30 bodies
* 136 accessories
* 19 glasses
+ Additional assets for the lower body (following existing colors):
* Approx. 30 pants
* Approx. 30 shoes
2. All assets rigged and animations clips preloaded into the GLTF models
3. A React + Three.JS (using react-three-fiber) interface that allows us to:
Load all 3D files and texture in a database
Create a front end with drop down menus for each of the six attributes + a 3D viewer in a viewport + 3-4 buttons to autoplay animations (idle, walk, run, dance).
Build a random function to compose 3D nouns as the default drop down.
Click a download button to get your rigged and textured 3D noun, ready to be imported in a game engine or 3D editing software (GLTF, OBJ, VOX etc)
We currently have a WIP proof of concept at [https://nouns.vercel.app](https://nouns.vercel.app). We bought [www.voxelnouns.com](www.voxelnouns.com) and [www.3Dnouns.com](www.3Dnouns.com). We also bought voxelnouns.eth and 3Dnouns.eth and will transfer them to the DAO on launch.
## Who Is Building This?

* OxFloyd - [https://twitter.com/0xFloyd](https://twitter.com/0xFloyd)
## Compensation
A total of 32 ETH to be transferred to the address below in one full payment:
* 28 ETH for V1 of the site as detailed in the scope of the project section
* 4 ETH for 1 year of maintenance including hosting, domain name, SSL certificate, cross-browser compatibility testing, mobile/desktop testing, back-ups, librairies/software upgrades. Also setting metric tools for checking website performance page load speed, responsiveness, stability, etc. If necessary, scaling for increased site traffic.

Subsequent years of maintenance and future improvements/features to come in separate proposals. For future improvements, see the list below.
## What Could Be Built on Top of 3D Nouns?
* Allow users to walk/run/jump and control their noun in a 3D world using the keyboard or touch screen on their mobile device.
* Allow users to download AR files (USDZ file).
* Allow users to upload their 3D nouns design following the voxel template and organize a competition where the best nouns are selected. This would require user accounts.
* Option to mint your own 3D noun.",EXECUTED,13108132,13127842,0,1,,0,0,0,19,12,0,0,['32000000000000000000'],['0x9c74ae08fd4337e14786f086d911e964df35e623'],[''],13094992,1629900565,0x5c987a70a2c837dec3f02a816b9a9e5483e2da1bc9c678a73a4e8dcb91e495ee,['0x'],0x2573c60a6d127755aa2dc85e342f7da2378a0cc5
3,Nouns Party,"# Nouns Party

Nouns party is an effort aimed at making community-driven nouns bidding easier, more interactive, and more likely to win than today's strategies. 

## Links
[Proposal Document](https://www.notion.so/Nouns-Party-020ce483fef64391831eb69d3e71fa74)

## Scope
The new [nouns.party](http://nouns.party) will include a completely updated design and several innovations which should dramatically simplify group bidding while increasing the odds of success. This will transition [nouns.party](http://nouns.party) from a simple fork to a pool-driven bidding application for nouns. This will require new contracts, a new application, and a new design. 

The following functionality will be included labeled by versions. V0 will be guaranteed to launch for the completion of this proposal. V1 items will be built as time permits within the 4-week scope. 

- **[V0]** Party contributions will be deposited in a ""vault"" style contract which carries forward from one noun auction to the next. These contributions will be withdraw-able at any time outside of an active winning bid. If they are not withdrawn, they **will automatically accumulate for the next noun auction.**
- **[V0]** Nouns won through these contributions will be automatically fractionalized for the winners. Contributors can then claim the shares of their winning noun. If multiple nouns are won, they can claim all shares at once.
- **[V0]** Real-time whale bidding viewer, to help inform the party. The UI will display any pending bids.
    - **[V1]** We will also show the estimated remaining Ethereum for the top bidder.
- **[V0]** Manual group bid submission when sufficient Ethereum is gathered.
    - **[V1]** Auto-bidder mechanism to avoid bidding confusion and democratize gas fees
- **[V0]** Currently nouns purchased through party bid must pay an upfront 5% Eth fee for each party noun. This fee is used for the ongoing maintenance and development of partybid. We propose the same fee, but instead of a ""pre-auction"" fee, we will introduce a post-auction fractionalization 5% token supply fee awarded to the nouns party multi-sig. This fee will apply to any nouns won through nouns party.
- **[V0]** Social Cursors with a noun-y style
    - **[V1]** If cursors become a UI burden, we will explore avenues to remove that burden
    - **[V1]** We will explore a social platformer-type game

## Contributors & Compensation

We ask that the nounsdao fund the design & development of this project. Additionally, we plan to introduce a 5%  per ""party noun"" win post-fractionalization fee (matching the existing fees of the party bid mechanic). This fee will be allocated to the [nouns.party](http://nouns.party) multi-sig.

## Future Direction
While we believe that nouns party is the highest impact work we can do today, we also believe there are many other exciting nouns' related behaviors that can be improved.  Those include predicting the next noun, announcing pending bids, and clarifying fractional governance. We also believe there are social aspects, such a ""register an e-mail to be notified"", which can open up additional nouns opportunities in the future.

We are excited to explore more opportunities in this direction.",EXECUTED,13155118,13174828,1,2,,0,0,0,27,14,0,0,"['48000000000000000000', '32000000000000000000', '8000000000000000000', '8000000000000000000']","['0x912a526852527dfb5d44c22a15b708aa493cda6b', '0xa340828b995016437351890d6b98aec698e2ef74', '0xbfc80468df050d2a73fe455d6b3e484caf00e12f', '0x73f843d1668e36a2952f2e505879fac9abbf3db4']","['', '', '', '']",13141978,1630529009,0xe71991fa2f6c3f282a61d1e90465058c9ee5627dcdfa7a9c7ec8a3c8b181d77d,"['0x', '0x', '0x', '0x']",0x912a526852527dfb5d44c22a15b708aa493cda6b
4,Verbs Prop 1: NOUN O'CLOCK AUTOMATION APP,"# Verbs Prop #1: NOUN O'CLOCK AUTOMATION APP

## IDEA: NOUN O'CLOCK AUTOMATION APP

We spoke with @4156#9052 and love his ideas of *Noun'o'clock* as an Internet cultural moment. We want to build momentum around this idea. One of the first steps is to build infrastructure that will enable anyone, even without coding abilities, to work with Noun auction metadata - specifically because of the shifting time of Noun'o'clock.

That's why the first project we would like to propose for your consideration is a Noun o'clock app on Zapier & Integromat.

This will enable anyone to work with basic Noun auction metadata, all with the most popular no-code automation tools.

## WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING

Zapier and Integromat apps have a trigger configuration and a data payload you'll receive when triggered.

### Trigger configuration

- You'll choose a time to be triggered relative to the next Noun o'clock
- The trigger will support auction extensions

### Trigger payload

- The current highest bid / the winner when it's post-o'clock: address + bid amount
- Bid history: address + bid amount
- Minimum bid
- The Noun
    - Art
    - Number
- Current treasury balance

### Concrete implementations as part of this proposal

- **Noun'o'clock reminder in the #general Discord**
    - With the help of a Nounder discord admin, we will add an automatic update for estimated Noun'o'clock as soon as a new auction is created
    - We will also add a reminder 1 hour and 5 minutes before Noun'o'clock (exact timing to be optimized as per community feedback)
- **Noun'o'clock reminders tweets on the @nounsdao account**
    - With the help of a Nounder twitter admin, we will add an automatic update for estimated Noun'o'clock as soon as a new auction is created
    - We will also add a reminder 1 hour and 5 minutes before Noun'o'clock (exact timing to be optimized as per community feedback)
- **Set up Nouns google calendar**
    - To enable people to plan for Noun'o'clock, we will set up a public Google calendar that anyone can subscribe to
    - We will automatically create an event for Noun'o'clock in the calendar using the Zapier (or Integromat) implementation

## EXAMPLE USE CASES

### **Noun'o'clock Twitter Bot**

- Help NFT twitter know when the next Noun'o'clock is
- Anyone will be able to easily create a twitter bot using the Noun'o'clock trigger that will execute as soon as the last auction is over

### Noun'o'clock reminder

- Always know when Noun'o'clock is with notification on Slack/Discord/SMS when Noun'o'clock is X minutes away
- Anyone will be able to create an alert system by building a simple automation
- Create sophisticated automations:
    - If the auction bid is lower than X and time is Y minutes away

### Track stats DIY

- people who want to track noun market data can create an automation to insert data to a Google sheet

## TECHNICAL SCOPE

- Web server that tracks Noun'o'clock, and invokes the automations at the desired time
- Zapier & Integromat apps
    - Using the Nouns favicon art as the apps' icon
- All code will be open sourced on Github
- SLA: 99% uptime

## REMUNERATION

- 11 ETH for the development scope listed above
- 1.5 ETH for estimated server costs for a year
- 2.5 ETH for estimated maintenance work for a year

15 ETH total.

Subsequent years of maintenance and future improvements/features to come in separate proposals.

6,Nouns iOS and Apple Watch app,"# Nouns iOS and Apple Watch app

**tl;dr**

In the interest of building momentum around Nouns as a cultural phenomenon and helping to reach a wider audience, we propose building a fun and quirky iOS app and companion Apple Watch app. These applications will create a playful Noun o’clock experience, allow Noun enthusiasts to explore all of the created Nouns, as well as play around with creating their own off-chain Nouns in fun and creative ways (among other features, examples below).

**Apple Watch Application:**
-   Nouns watch face
  -   Fun and goofy way to keep track of time (working within the constraints of Apple watch and WatchOS 8)
  -   Background photo
-   Custom Watch complication for Noun o’clock
-   Notification about Noun o’clock
-   Watch app can display:
  -   Noun avatar as watch face
  -   Noun o’clock countdown
  -   Generate your own (off chain Noun)
  -   Share Nouns (iMessage, or share sheet)


**iOS App**
-   Notifications about Noun o’clock
-   Make your own Noun (offchain) - similar to [https://nouns.wtf/playground/](https://nouns.wtf/playground/)
  -   Use it as your watch face
  -   Save it and use it as an avatar
  -   Share it with others (way to enable virality/spread of Nouns)
  -   There’s an opportunity to make this very playful and tactile by letting users shake their phone to generate a random Noun or swipe to edit characteristics

-   Nouns explorer
  -   Browse a record/catalogue of all of the onchain Nouns that have been minted and sold thus far, with additional meta-data
  -   Browse a saved record of personal “saved” off-chain Nouns created by the user (using the app)

-   Future extensions
  -   Nouns iOS widget for your homescreen  
  -   iMessage sticker pack

**Technical Considerations**
-   App will be built in Swift and backend in Node + Typescript
  -   Open question: are there any existing internal Nouns APIs we can leverage for some of the data similar to the Nouns explorer project
  -   Target operating systems will be iOS 15 and WatchOS 8 which is set to release later this month
  -   All code will be open sourced. Our goal is to encourage others in the community to extend the apps and leverage the assets for the Android Nouns app.

**Design Considerations**
The overall design aesthetic for this product is meant to be consistent with the overall visual design of the nouns.wtf website, the Nouns themselves, and just generally be contemporary, modern, and fun.
-   Share figma file and screen shots, enable comments from the community
-   Describe interactions and other functional aspect of the design like flows in the figma file as well for inspection and commentary
-   In the spirit of open source, we will involve the Nouns community to participate and influence the app development in a number of key ways:
  -   Open sourcing the code via github for inspection by the community
  -   Providing updates on the design and development regularly via discord
  -   Allowing actual Nounders and members of Nouns DAO to participate in feedback sessions and select user/usability testing sessions to improve build quality.
  -   Open up a public beta of the app for the Nouns community (Noun holders and non-holders) to participate in via test flight.

**Timeline**
Concept, design and development is scoped to 4 months. See schedule below:
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BgbXeDvLixaC72v2vyE2fItB6m-_4AzgaEG6muxCixa-Xi0pKJSkU5DCCAE30DmjLSMgOuTT4PjOcyw6jJuf3F32P1eqbp-NffE617AU8vZlotywwkCOEF-F9ljK4Mx5kaJihnbT=s0)


**Co-creation**
We love to build in public and plan to work in close collaboration with the Nouns community, through co-creation workshops and consistent feedback loops via Discord. We will be running a beta test of both the iOS and Watch applications to identify bugs early and other deficiencies, in the aim of increasing build quality and level of polish before launch.

**Team**

7,NOUNS x NOIR,"# NOUNS x NOIR

This proposal is to fund and execute phase 1 of the NOUNS X NOIR project.

## Summary of Phase 1: 

This phase relates to the design and scouting aspects of the project.

#### Objectives:
- Originate the forms of each sculpture.
- Decide which Noun the Nouns sculpture shall be based on or to design the process for selecting the Noun.
- Scout for locations for the sculptures.

#### Timescale:
- A timeline of 3 months is anticipated in order to achieve the above objectives.

## Nouns x Noir Proposal

### Origin of the Project

To further proliferate Nouns, a NOUNS X NOIR collab for a public art project is proposed. The project entails creating two 4 metre (12 foot) high bronze sculptures that will stand side by side in a major international city. One sculpture shall be of Nouns and the other will be of Noir.

### What is it?

#### Art
The Nouns sculpture will be based on one Noun. The selection process of the Noun could be contentious and the process will need to be established, or at the least explored, in advance of any funding. The process needs to be collectively agreed on by the Nouns.

Noir's sculpture will be an iconic 'Super Classic Head' of the kind Noir originated on the Berlin Wall in the 1980s. Noir’s early physical world avatars clandestinely painted on the Wall were a form of political activism through art and represented the people of Berlin at the time.

The NOUNS x NOIR sculptures are intended to be harmonious. Equal in height and overall proportions. Yet a juxtaposition will be apparent between the pixelated Noun and the more rounded analogue Noir. The sculptures are intended to be original works of original art and are not statues.  
  
#### Method
Both sculptures will be cast at the largest fine art bronze foundry in Europe and either traditionally patinated or painted. A suitable permanent and prominent public location will be secured in a major international city and the sculptures will be installed together in dialogue.

The entire process of creation at the foundry through to installation shall be documented through film (ground and drone), photography and timelapse. Each stage of traditional bronze casting shall be captured.

The story of the project shall be told.

The resulting documentary will attract an audience drawn from both the native crypto world and the art world and propagate a crossover between the two worlds.

### Scope of the Project
#### Project management and fabricators
Thierry Noir and his studio team will oversee the day to day management of the project.

The proposed bronze foundry is Pangolin Editions ([https://pangolin-editions.com](https://pangolin-editions.com)). Pangolin Editions is one of the foremost fine art bronze foundries in the world and extremely highly regarded.

For transportation and public installation, MTEC are proposed ([https://www.mtecfreightgroup.com](https://www.mtecfreightgroup.com)). MTEC specialise in the installation of public sculptures internationally.

Both organisations have already been engaged about the project and have provided quotations for the work.

#### Public location
To justify the effort and expense of the project, the intention is to situate the NOUNS x NOIR sculptures at a permanent location in a major international city such as New York, London, Paris, Seoul or Tokyo.

A major public area within the selected city is also essential to the legacy of the project. A public park or square will be the desired location. This will allow the sculptures to become an iconic landmark within the city and also serve as a meeting point.

Such a location will also facilitate the greatest number of people as possible to enjoy them, provide an aesthetically pleasing and iconic backdrop and create high culture impact internationally.

The ideal is to locate the sculptures on municipal land and not privately owned land. This chimes with the themes of freedom within the art of both Nouns and Noir.

A 99 year lease (based on a standard form public art precedent) of the sculptures will be granted to the location.

#### Past Discussions
[Initial discussion on Nouns DIscord](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-x-noir-proposal/87)
[Further discussion on Nouns DAO Discourse](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/884419393864495114/884513517535912026)

This project is phase specific with further advancement based upon the success of the preceding phase as decided by the Nouns DAO.

  

## Phase 1: Design and Scouting

This proposal relates to the first design and scouting phase of the project.

#### Objectives:
- Originate the forms of each sculpture.
- Decide which Noun the Nouns sculpture shall be based on or to design the process for selecting the Noun.
- Scout for locations for the sculptures.

#### Timescale:
- A timeline of 3 months is anticipated in order to achieve the above objectives.

  

### Progression to Phase 2: Fabrication and Installation

Should the outcome of the design process be deemed unsuccessful from a collaborative, aesthetic or other standpoint the project will likely not progress to Phase 2.

Should locations for the sculptures not be forthcoming then the project will likely not progress to Phase 2. If a location should then present itself in the future the option will remain to resume the project, such a decision will be subject to NounsDAO decision making.

An initial outline draft of Phase 2 is below. This draft document provides and overview of the bronze casting process and detail around the public installation of the sculptures. A budget based on official quotes from suppliers is also laid out.

[Phase 2: Fabrication and Installation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q8ZomF3u5WzWsQtWeg_QCW0KbOlAG5VAiI0dshLAF0E/edit#)

### Compensation
The artist is not seeking any compensation for his work on this project, will dedicate over a year of studio time to both phases of the project and is donating all project management resources. The artist can also add extra funding if needed.

Following an invitation from the Nouns, the NOUNS x NOIR project is envisioned as a collaboration. It is therefore fitting that both sides should provide resources to the project.

The hope is that the project will be regarded as an important art historical crossover between two distinct artistic movements. Purely from an artistic standpoint, the prospect to work on an important public art project such as this is compensation alone.

The nature and spirit of Noir’s artworks originated on the Berlin Wall has since resulted in a largely self funded public art practice outside any top down commissioning processes. This project is being approached in a similar fashion.

### Budget
Some hard costs arise do arise out of this phase of the project to a total of Ξ5

- (i) sculpting and CAD design at the bronze foundry Ξ2;
- (ii) CNC milling and 3D printing of maquettes Ξ1;
- (iii) initial structural engineering work Ξ1; and
- (iv) travel provision for international site visits Ξ1.

#### Funding Schedule

Ξ5 payable at the onset of the project.

8,FOMO Nouns,"# FOMO Nouns

## What Is It?

We propose a tool that allows the Nouns community to vote on and mint the most appealing Nouns for each auction in real time.

As background, Nouns are psuedo-randomly generated for each auction based on the block when the prior auction is settled. Each block generates a unique Noun, and recent auctions have been settled on a random block when either the auction winner wants to receive their Noun or a random user wants to start the next auction.

We believe the Noun community can benefit from more deliberating selecting the next Noun for a number of reasons:
 - More appealing Nouns build the appeal of the Nouns art
 - More appealing Nouns have generally garnered higher bids in recent auctions. This helps build the Nouns treasury and influence.
 - Voting enables wider community participation in the Nouns project even for users who don't hold and are unlikely to win a Noun
 - The voting and settlement setup provides even more excitement around Noun O'Clock

We propose building a website that will allow community members to vote on whether to settle in a given block and mint a particular Noun, and if sufficient votes are received, immediately settle the auction in the same block to mint the desired Noun.


### Origin of the Project

This idea grew out of Shark DAO's interest in forcing a Shark to be minted for the DAO to acquire. After some discussion, we realized the whole Nouns community may have preferences on what Nouns to mint, and we could set this up as a platform for the community to voice their preferred attributes for the benefit of the broader Nouns ecosystem.

| ![](https://i.imgur.com/Qr903QF.jpg =200x200) | ![](https://i.imgur.com/HCfkVnO.jpg =200x200) |


## Project Details

The website will allow users to see the Noun mintable in every block (approximately every 15 seconds). It will also contain relevant information and analytics (e.g. available settlement funds, whether any attributes would be the first minted).

In a short window after each block appears, users will be able to vote on whether the new Noun is attractive enough to mint. Voting may be binary (i.e. yes/no) or score based (i.e. 0-10), and it will require a threshold that adjusts based on the number of active users. MetaMask sign-in will be required to prevent vote spamming.

All features will aim to be fun, social, and interface. Ideas include voting via emoji (🤢 to 🥰), social cursor interactions (ala PartyBid), a real-time vote progress bar, and/or POAP awards for some-or-all participants during voting.

### Early Mock-up
![](https://i.imgur.com/VSM5otQ.png =50%x50%)

Votes will be tallied in real-time on the backend. If a sufficient number of votes are received, settlement will be instantly initiated. Settlement must occur in the same-block, so Flashbots will be used to speed inclusion. This will require a contract to provide miner tips and ensure the settlement transaction is not mined in later blocks.

A contract will be also be built to store community donations and fund settlement costs.


## Project Deliverables

The project will encompass the following deliverables and support for 1 year.

 * **Development**
     * Frontend:
         * Instant display of mintable Nouns
         * Metamask integration
         * Voting mechanism
         * Social integration for chat, emojis, other fun mechanics
         * Relevant Noun analytics & history
     * Backend:
         * Aggregate and store user votes
         * Calculate and store relevant Noun analytics
         * Secure kick-off of auction settlement
     * Contract:
         * Accept community donations to fund settlement
         * Pay for instant block inclusion (via Flashbots)
         * Ensure late block inclusion is prevented
     * E2E Speed:
         * Settlement must occur **extremely** rapidly to ensure inclusion requiring tuning and optimizing each component
 * **Infrastructure & Deployment** (1 year)
     * Frontend:
         * Domain name registration
         * Website hosting & SSL
         * Alchemy/Infura monitoring integration
     * Backend:
         * Redis (or other storage) hosting
         * Settlement infrastructure
         * Alchemy/Infura settlement integration
     * Contract:
         * Contract deployment
         * Settlement contract tests

## Project Funding

We propose funding of **50 ETH** to help support the deliverables above. This will be split:
 - 28 ETH to [@_forager](https://twitter.com/_forager) for settlement backend, contract for donations and Flashbots payment, on-chain Nouns monitoring and analytics components
 - 22 ETH to [@0xrayo](https://twitter.com/0xRayo) for the front end, back end, and analytics

Start-up deployment and infrastructure costs will be covered under development costs. The website and infrastructure will be supported for a minimum of 1 year. Support after that period will fall under a seperate proposal and/or be left for community support.

Settlement costs will not be included in this proposal. Normal settlement costs ~0.05 ETH, and fast inclusion may require additional payment for higher gas or Flashbots miner tips. Community donations will be solicited to support this expense.


## Miscellanea

### Project Ethos
The project code will be open sourced under GNU GPLv3 with all code shared on GitHub upon project completion. Our goal is to help the Nouns community build the best roster of Nouns possible, promote the Nouns project, and maximally expand the Nouns treasury by driving higher bids on attractive Nouns.

### Limitations and Risks
Noun auction settlement can be performed by any user. While recent auctions have taken ~10 blocks (and community may accept longer), it's possible for a competing tool or mischevious user to settle the auction immediately or on an undesirable Noun. However, this is possible even without this project, and we can adjust our configuration to minimize the impact of this type of activity.

Settlement on a specific block is also not guaranteed, and there may be situations where users vote for a Noun but settlement does not occur. There will be a tradeoff between settlement guarantee, time allowed for voting, and the transaction cost. We will optimize the whole system as much as possible in order to strike the best possible balance between these factors.

The project will require a balance of ETH to settle each auction. Community donations will be needed, after a brief testing period, for the tool to continue to be useful. In addition, gas fees on Ethereum are volatile, so we may need to skip settlement or pay very high fees if the network is congested at the time an auction ends.

9,Nouns Bidder POAP,"# Nouns Bidder POAP

This proposal is to fund the 1st half of the payment for the Nouns Bidder POAP Project that takes that project to its Season 1 completion. Upon successful completion, I will propose another Proposal to fund the 2nd half to compensate the team for their work.

**Nouns Bidder POAP tl;dr**

As more and more people find out about Nouns and make their way to the main auction page, we wanted to propose a way to not only invite people to bid on Nouns, but to reward them for bidding as well. Our proposal, in order to bring about this excitement for bidding/settling, is to create a microsite/landing page where all people who have previously bid on, or settled, a Noun will have the ability to claim a free POAP, marking, on-chain, their involvement in and excitement for the Nouns community.

[Nouns Discourse discussion](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-bidder-poap/243)

**Microsite/Landing Page Details**

Below you will find key details on the thought and tech behind how our team plans to tackle this project.

**POAP (Proof Of Attendance Protocol) | What even is it?**

* In the simplest of terms, POAP is a system that event organizers can use to distribute unique badges/NFTs (ERC-721 tokens) to people that show up to their event (whether physical or digital). It also provides an open standard for developers to build on.
* Our team will be building out a microsite with the ability to claim a POAP for digitally attending (bidding on or settling) a Nouns Auction.
* You will be able to have this badge, this NFT, in your wallet, showing publicly your involvement in the Nouns Auction process and your belief in the proliferation of the Nouns ecosystem.

* We will be using etherscan.io data from the [Nouns DAO: Nouns Auction House Proxy](https://etherscan.io/address/0x830bd73e4184cef73443c15111a1df14e495c706) to pull all addresses with bid and settle functions from each auction in order to verify your involvement and allow you to claim your POAP through the site.
* We will be leveraging the [poap.xyz](http://poap.xyz) platform and API in order to create the cleanest experience for the claimer.

*AMENDMENT BEGINS*

**POAP Claiming Threshold**

Through community feedback and concern, we have amended this proposal by adding a claiming threshold. The threshold is based on a runners-up bidding function.

* A POAP will be rewarded/be able to be claimed by the five (5) runners-up for every auction (unique wallets only, back-and-forth bidding will not be rewarded with multiple POAPs)
* There will also be one (1) POAP reserved for anyone who settles an auction.
* The reasoning behind this amendment is for two key reasons.
  * First: Having unlimited POAPs available with the only requirement being a bid, would open the door to countless spam bidders, resulting in the arbitrary burning of gas.
  * Second: By restricting the POAPs to only be claimed by the 5 runners-up allows for the value of the POAP to stay in-line with that of Nouns, while still being attainable by a broader audience. If there is an auction that receives exceptionally high offers, the POAP reserved for a Settler, still allows for anyone, no matter the wallet size, to have the chance at receiving a Noun Bidders POAP.

*AMENDMENT ENDS*

**Technical Considerations + Source Code**

* The tech stack will be Typescript, React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS
* High emphasis on mobile-first usability and functional programming
* Site will be deployed to Vercel and will use their CI/CD pipeline
* Code will be open-sourced on Github so others can fork it and create their own POAP claim landing pages in the future
* We will have both a staging and production site for testing & bug-prevention
* Leverage the POAP API where possible ([poap.xyz](http://poap.xyz))

**Design**

* ***Design of the POAP***
  * Nounish beings by Sun-Min + David
  * Each Nounish being holds a numbered auction bid paddle marking in history the specific Noun that your bid was counted for
* ***Design of the Microsite***
  * Create wireframes in Figma and generate a low-fidelity interactive prototype (mobile and web)
  * Upload prototype into maze.design and test with the nouns community/discord to ensure that key tasks can be completed
  * Iterate on prototype to resolve any usability issues based on feedback
  * Once wireframes are validated, we’ll conduct two rounds of visual design to and share back with community
    * Leverage tailwind design components for easy and efficient build
    * Comments will be enabled to review feedback asynchronously and directly in the design
    * The website will be branded similarly to nouns.wtf (Londrina Solid font for headlines, Segoe UI for body text, grays and whites)

**Project Timeline**

Our team anticipates this project taking approximately 6-8 weeks. You can view our proposed schedule below. (subject to change based on reviews and approvals by the NounsDAO)

Community co-creation, as many of the other proposals have stated, is our goal. As you can see below, we will have three dedicated times where we will gather community input through Discord and other channels from the NounsDAO community in order to ship this product with the community’s highest standard in mind.

# **Nouns Comic** 

**Nouns Comic: TL;DR**

Comics are the perfect way to maintain ""Memetic Consistency"" that is the very base for NounsDAO. Through comics we're able to share our interest over Nouns and their exciting world over specific events (i.e. Party Nouns) and also log NounsDAO's history in an amusing comedic way.
Some much-needed adjustments and changes were applied to the [original draft](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-comic-a-proposal/210/7) after ""[Nouns Comic #0](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/21cba21352c5d4ec404a6be793d1a45c633eed4a.jpeg)"" was published. Here's the final version of the Nouns Comic proposal.

**Nouns and Storytelling.**

In a world where everything changes, humans have maintained one consistent feature and that’s the “**art of storytelling**”. Storytelling is and has been one of our favorite ways of communication, from cave-drawings and sharing tales of discovering fire to building the metaverse ~ we all want to share stories that we find interesting.

**Why Comics?**

Nouns Comic are that fun and engaging tool that we can use to share our interest for Nouns and their exciting universe to build upon. It’s a way to keep that memetic consistency that we so desire to maintain inside the Nouns community/universe. An event, if you will, to gather around and enjoy the things happening in the community with a mixture of my wild imaginations about Nouns and how they’d interact with each other.

**Nouns Comic you say?**

“Nouns Comic #0” is already out and available for the community and all Noun enthusiasts. The full version can be found below.

“Nouns Comic #0” serves as the “**WTF? Handbook**” which is a meme translation of the [Nouns website](https://nouns.wtf) while introducing different concepts like *Noun o’clock*, *Nouns treasury*, *Nouns’ art on-chain* and… in an amusing comedic way in “*internet language*”.

[Nouns Comic #0](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/855538581434007635/894304410182746182/SPOILER_Nouns_Comic_0_-_Final.jpg)


Moving forward, all comics will be available for ***free*** on the Nouns Comic website/archive to log the history of Nouns Comic. Everyone will have access to both *.jpeg* and *.pdf* versions of the comic and they will be accessible for everyone. Also, a very limited number of comics will be minted for collectors that are interested in owning a piece of Nouns Comic history that comes with the animated version of the cover.

**Budget and Timeframe**

* 10 days per comic
* 0.5 ETH per comic
* Lasting for 3 months (9 issues)

That will bring the total to **4.5ETH** for **9 upcoming issues** over the span of **3 months** (90 days) to be synced with **Party Nouns** (Nouns ending with 1). 

Notes:
- The comics will be extended over the 3 months period if agreed upon by both parties ~ details will be discussed in a future proposal.
- 25% of the initial revenue generated from “special editions” will go back to the NounsDAO treasury.

**Proof of Work?**

Undead Oracle here ~ Artist and content-creator focused on internet culture and visual storytelling through art. I’ve always been focused on sharing stories and content with others, from drawing comics and sharing them with my peers throughout school to bringing my collection (“[The Undead](https://opensea.io/collection/theundead)”) to the main-net, I have always focused on storytelling and growing as an artist.

12,Perpetual Glasses to Kids In Need V2,"**Perpetual Glasses to Kids In Need V2**
===
**NounsDAO Grant Proposal**
By Joshua Fisher & Fitz Frames

**tl;dr**
In celebration of the fact that every Noun is a glasses wearer, Fitz Frames would like to propose a perpetual funding allocation to deliver prescription eyeglasses to children in need. 
Fitz Frames in partnership with Vision to Learn (as well as additional outreach partners) can deliver a no-cost eye exam plus an annual membership to Fitz Frames for children in need.  A Fitz Frames membership includes two complete pairs of prescription eyeglasses with unlimited replacement frames should they lose, break, grow out of the glasses, or their prescription changes.
In addition to their Fitz Frames Membership each child will receive an additional free pair of Noun Frames, glasses that mimic the pair worn by their favorite Noun.
As an initial pilot program, we propose Nouns DAO allocate **9ETH** (~$30,000 worth of ETH) to provide glasses to approximately 300 kids (aprox $100) per child. This will be done with in conjunction with our outreach partner Vision to Learn in an initial focus geography (probably Ohio and/or Detroit). Progress reports will be given to NounsDAO on an ongoing basis, but no less than once a quarter. The pilot program is expected to run approximately 90 days, but children will continue to receive replacement glasses for the full year as needed. The purpose of the pilot program is to validate and refine the offering and delivery process, with the goal of expanding the efforts nationwide and eventually internationally.
At the end of the initial pilot program, Fitz present the results of the program and will put to a vote either a continuation, expansion, or termination of the program.
Additionally, we request **2ETH** in one-time funding to build outreach materials (print, animation, and website) directed towards schools to explain the program, Nouns, Fitz, and the underlying technology of blockchain, NFTs, and additive manufacturing.

**Proposal**
Fitz would like to eventually build to a perpetual funding mechanism in order to expand our existing social good efforts and deliver eyewear on an ongoing basis to kids in need. In the interim, we’d like to propose a pilot program to prove out the model and refine delivery mechanism:
- $30K allocation from Nouns treasury to provide approximately 300 no-cost vision tests plus Fitz Frames memberships to kids in need, initially in a limited geographical focus area.
- Fitz will provide annual memberships at cost of $100)/kid/year discounted from $185.  Annual Membership consists of two pairs of custom fit glasses plus unliminted replacements.
- Fitz will provide an additional free pair of Noun Frames, mimicking their favorite Nouns, limited to an initial selection of 10 Noun options for the Pilot Program.
- Vision to Learn, will identify recipients and provide no-cost eye exams within the geographical focus area. Initial prospects are Ohio and Detroit.
- Initial Pilot Program is expected to run approximately 90 days, at which point Fitz will present a report of progress to the NounsDAO.
- At that point the NounsDAO can vote to expand, continue, or suspend the pilot program.
- Based on findings from the initial Pilot Program, elements can be refined including: delivery mechanism, offering, and outreach. Additionally, Fitz Frames will work to try and secure additional underwriting in order to extend the reach of the program. (possibly through Medicaid reimbursement, or local philanthropic partners)

- In order to promote the program (and help surface Nouns to a wider public awareness) we propose dedicating an additional 2ETH to develop outreach materials including print, short form animation, and a dedicated website. This will target schools, the student recipients of glasses, and broader public. In addition to promotion of the program, this is an opportunity to introduce the technology elements underpinning both Nouns and Fitz Frames, and develop age-appropriate STEM curriculum for the kids who receive the glasses.
Nouns is a fantastic example of people leveraging technology to come together and build long-term value in perpetuity.  Fitz leverages the power of technology to change the lives of kids. We think this is a natural partnership that would not only do a tremendous amount of good, but could serve as tangible application of blockchain doing tangible good. At Fitz, we believe that those who can see the world are the ones who can change the world. NounsDAO embodies this ethos completely, and we couldn’t imagine a better partner.

**Noun Frames**
Fitz will integrate Nouns Frames into their application so that users can pick their favorite Noun and receive glasses that mimic those frames as well as have the Noun itself printed on the side of the frames as well as the Noun number printed on the inside.

13,Retroactive Funding and Small Grants Pool,"# Retroactive Funding and Small Grants Pool

> *tl;dr -- Encourage creators (artists and devs) to build with Nouns by having a pool of funds held in a Safe for this purpose. The Safe will be used immediately to recognize existing a few creators in our community while also allowing fast funding of small, one-off, or alpha version projects as they appear.*


### Past and Fast
While Nouns DAO governance works well for larger projects, the multi-step, on-chain proposal process is not ideal for encouraging small, one-off, or alpha versions of projects/tooling. Despite this, many Nouns community members have added to the ecosystem and it would be great to honor their contribution.

To solve both of these issues, we'd like to propose that a pool of capital be sent to a Nouners controlled Safe. A Safe is much quicker mechanism to coordinate and distribute funds. We would like 20 ETH to pilot the pool, with a suggested range of 0.25-2 ETH per project, with the aim of:

1. acknowledging, through retroactive funding, past contributions to the Nouns ecosystem
1. granting funds for the development of small, one-off, or alpha version projects
1. encouraging building and signalling that retroactive funding is a viable way to build on Nouns


### Funding Committee
The initial signing committee on the Safe will be:
- ![](https://bafkreiagjoe5qu3mcl37dwki2vp4fj4gb7kccmflsn2aaf7tzomoe7kw7a.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 12
- ![](https://bafkreiffeqnv4rgab7e5o6vmn77ybkp3iuvcgjfu64lpu7yixiwhp7y3ty.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 16
- ![](https://bafkreigj6v7xwubod6ustllhc5jjrhpeggzsyrmjodvqgq47zshzh2l3xi.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 22
- ![](https://bafkreifald3ya6i62qy3s2mfefbzxnnkb25wazvqlnco3nr4xzuq6a7pae.ipfs.dweb.link/) Noun 32
- ![](https://bafkreiaalajwukk3wfocjcbl6a7uufkcsepeerhvunmnyjewfhnipqn2v4.ipfs.dweb.link/) Nouns DAO

The Safe will require `2 of 4` Nouners to sign, with Nouns DAO acting as a largely symbolic owner and backup.

The committee will monitor the builder community, retroactively fund previous work as it comes up, and receive informal requests/applications for small project grants. The projects and amounts will be at the committee's discretion.


### Who to Retro Fund Right Now
In addition to the 20 ETH Safe, we proposal the immediate funding of the following creators:
* `1 ETH` to [12BNoun](https://twitter.com/12bnoun) for developing many projects including [Nounspedia](https://twitter.com/12bnoun/status/1441940187794132994?s=20), [This-or-that](https://want2bnoun.herokuapp.com/), and [Synthetic Nouns](https://twitter.com/12bnoun/status/1445013643737776132?s=20)
* `0.75 ETH` to [humpstyles](https://twitter.com/humpstyles) for their original, Nouns-based art [Abstract Nouns](https://opensea.io/collection/abstract-nouns)
* `0.75 ETH` [Zeeraffe](https://twitter.com/TheZeeraffe), [JustKiddinc](https://twitter.com/justkidddinc), and [WNX](https://twitter.com/syazwanamidun) for continuing to create one [Nouns Vox](https://opensea.io/collection/voxelnouns) daily
* `0.25` ETH to [aaaaaaaaaa](https://twitter.com/3pa15) for setting up a [Dune Analytics Dashboard](https://twitter.com/3pa15/status/1439723133586612226?s=20) for Noun Auction stats.

16,Proposal to name a recently discovered species of glass frog after Nouns,"# Proposal to name a recently discovered species of glass frog after Nouns

I have been informed of an opportunity to name a species of glass frog newly discovered in the Dracula nature reserve in Ecuador. The EcoMinga Foundation (EcoMinga Foundation) is raising funds alongside its partner Rainforest Trust (www.rainforesttrust.org 2) in exchange for the right to name this glass frog.

I’d like to propose that NounsDAO pay 25 ETH to purchase the right to name the frog Hyalinobatrachium Nouns, or Nouns Glassfrog in plain English. As far as I know, naming a species would be a first for the crypto and NFT community. Frogs have memetic value in the NFT community, making this species an appropriate choice for naming. Not only would this story be likely to get picked up by the press and social media, but the money goes to the cause of protecting biodiversity and rainforests.

Here is a link to some photos of the frog, and the scientific write up of the frog's discovery (along with another similar frog). https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w5kmr9hyzvlxjwo/AABrxnch8PAYop8MQ-FTrozEa?dl=0

The breakdown of the use of funds would be roughly the following, subject to discussions with the non-profits:
55% to Ecominga for operating and protecting the reserve
5% to scientific publishing and discovery of new species
40% to Rainforest Trust’s Climate Action Fund, which funds protection of rainforest to sequester carbon

Once this proposal passes and the ETH gets sent, I'll calculate the equivalent USD amount and wire the fiat to Rainforest Trust within 5 business days (unfortunately the non-profit doesn't accept crypto donations). Rainforest Trust will then pass on Ecominga's portion to them.

17,"Fund design, engineering, and community contributors","# Fund design, engineering, and community contributors

### Descripton

Nouns has the opportunity to fund a designer, engineer, and community lead in residency to help push forward day-to-day efforts. Scope for these contributions is considered open-ended, and will be defined on a monthly cadence with the input of the Nounders & the community. This proposal seeks to bring on three individuals with deep interest in the Nouns ecosystem, and a proven track record of delivering value on short timelines & at an early stage.

### Context

As part of their original contributions, the Nounders built [Nouns.wtf](http://Nouns.wtf), home to daily Noun auctions, governance, an exploratory playground, and details of the project and its motivations. Given the rapid increase in interest and usage of the Nouns products, we propose bringing on world-class design & engineering resourcing to help iterate on the future of [Nouns.wtf](http://Nouns.wtf).

Many Nounders remain involved in varying capacities in day-to-day community affairs, but the demands of the role are non-trivial and [critical to the success of any DAO](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1450990370528141315?s=20). We propose bringing on a talented community lead who will help strengthen the sense of shared purpose within the Nouns community.

### Scope

Scope for these contributors will be defined on an on-going basis with input from Nounders, Noun owners, and the greater Nouns community. Contributors will be expected to communicate their deliverables & timelines in a public manner at least once per month. 

For the design & engineering roles, the initial set of scope includes maintenance and improvements to [Nouns.wtf](http://Nouns.wtf). For the community role, contributions include (but are not limited to) scheduling & leading community calls, internal & external communications, Discord management, and onboarding of new DAO members.

### Expectations

Contributors are responsible for documenting and communicating their decisions & output. Updates should be shared early and often, encouraging Nounders and community members to provide input given the shared vision for the Nouns ecosystem. Contributors are expected to be responsive, but are free to define the working style which lends itself to the best outcomes. The commitments will last for **3 months**, or 90 days, after which point this proposal will be resubmitted to extend the working relationship.

### Contributors

Information on the contributors is available in [this post](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/898682149585162270/907593435417038889) in #private on the Nouns Discord.

### Compensation

We believe that the NounsDAO could fund this proposal, decreasing the burden of project maintenance on the Nounders and increasing the lifespan of product & community development for the community. For this initial trial, compensation will be paid out via streaming payments on Sablier. Each contributor will be paid `~5.9 ETH` per month, for approximately three months, or `~17.69 ETH` over 91 days. In the case of poor performance, the `cancelStream` method may be invoked, returning funds to an escrow and the contributor(s) pro-rata based on time elapsed.

The proposal also includes a transfer of `0.22 ETH` to [0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e](https://etherscan.io/address/0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e) as reimbursement for submitting the on-chain proposal.",EXECUTED,13635903,13655613,0,10,,0,0,0,109,46,0,0,"['53100000000000000000', '0', '0', '0', '0', '220000000000000000']","['0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2', '0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2', '0xcd18eaa163733da39c232722cbc4e8940b1d8888', '0xcd18eaa163733da39c232722cbc4e8940b1d8888', '0xcd18eaa163733da39c232722cbc4e8940b1d8888', '0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e']","['deposit()', 'approve(address,uint256)', 'createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256)', 'createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256)', 'createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256)', '']",13622763,1637012810,0x4e11d00ebd4216631ab5ca9e381ead85910802f56641748f1b5372ecdfae6c4a,"['0x', '0x000000000000000000000000cd18eaa163733da39c232722cbc4e8940b1d8888000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002e0e918aa053d8f80', '0x000000000000000000000000a1c0b11b86a46885b87c7ed68b91faa0c349e1cd000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f5a30838ac69da80000000000000000000000000c02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000061a175000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000062196d80', '0x000000000000000000000000bb3250a7bbe83e3e821c43ef3d780944d24019cb000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f5a30838ac69da80000000000000000000000000c02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000061a175000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000062196d80', '0x0000000000000000000000002548e6d6f1f0cd0d7f41355ee38066ede6a7ee0a000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f5a30838ac69da80000000000000000000000000c02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc20000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000061a175000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000062196d80', '0x']",0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e

**TL;DR**
Make 4x Nouns-based short films of different genres, aesthetics, and techniques, to see nouns come to life and help kick-start the nouns storytelling ecosystem.

**Nouns in Motion**
How do Nouns come to life? Let’s make it happen and find out!

To contribute to the elevation of Nouns to cultural icon status, broaden the scope and understanding of what the Nouns characters can be, and also to encourage contribution and interactivity in Nouns-art-making, we will create 4 short films centered around Nouns.

We will explore the creative potential of Nouns by making each film with totally different genres and techniques. From this we will learn what works, what doesn’t, and inform what motion strategies we should explore next.

These short films will be the first of their kind, and hopefully will inspire other creators from the broader community to generate more motion projects featuring the Nouns.

This is just a first step to dip Nouns’ toes in the water of motion storytelling and for us all to learn. We have grand ideas for how this first step can seed one or potentially many Nouns content projects, including but not limited to: creating even more elevated Nouns content, creating a platform for Nouns in motion (or Nouns art generally), an ongoing narrative series, curated anthologies from artists around the world, and community-contributed storytelling.

**The Films**
We want to cover as many genres and techniques as possible to be able to experiment and learn from how Nouns translate into all these different outcomes. Ideally, no two films will cover the same ground. Let’s explore...

**Genres:** drama, comedy, experimental, family, action, adventure, romance, adventure, musical, thriller...

**Medium / Technique:** Pixel art, traditional 2D animation, 3D animation, stop-motion, live action, puppetry, augmented reality...

Award winning hybrid production company Pixel and web3 media collective StudioDAO will form the Nouns Stories team and collaborate to create all 4 films. Each film will have a different director but may share some production team members.

**Distribution & Sale**
We are currently thinking about releasing one film per week for a month in 2022 (but are open to suggestions or ideas on this). It would be great to premiere them at noun'o'clock every monday for example The films will be made as accessible as possible and shared for free, potentially on many networks and platforms. We believe Nouns content should not be gatekept, our goal should be to reach the largest audience possible (and encourage others to do so).

The films themselves will be CC0 and everyone will be encouraged to use them however they wish. NounsStories team may decide that its a good idea to enter the films into festivals or other events or platforms around the world to increase both reach and gain prestige. The films shall always remain accessible online (and free) however, and we should not ever conform to any requests to pull them down in order to participate in an event (some film festivals may require this in order to screen at their events).

The films might also be minted as NFTs, ideally on a custom NounsStories contract, and auctioned off (and pending the level of success, perhaps assets, elements from the production, or offshoot artwork and content could be minted too). Ideally the royalites from these sales would go to the artists that are responsible for the film's creation.

*Written by Noun 12 but he can't propose because there's only 1 Live Proposal per proposing address at a time.*

The proposal is for Nouns DAO to become a matching partner to the tune of 169 ETH for the Gitcoin Grants Round 12 starting December 1st. We will also commission the artists behind the successful Gitcoin Moonshot Bot NFTs to make a series of 5 Moonshot Nouns, 1 of which will be auctioned over the course of the round with the proceeds going to Gitcoin general fund, and 4 of which will go to winners that the Nouns community selects from each GR12 category (Climate, Advocacy, Longevity, Ethereum), in a limited edition NFT crossover event.

[Discourse Discussion for A Very Nounish Gitcoinmas](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-a-very-nounish-gitcoinmas-nft-crossover-event-169-eth-to-crypto-public-goods/369)

**What's Gitcoin?**

* Gitcoin is a crypto-native public goods funding and open source jobs & coordination platform successfully built and spun out of Consensys into a DAO with its own ERC-20 ($GTC). [Gitcoin has raised $40 million for open source and public goods funding in its lifetime](https://gitcoin.co/results).  One popular Gitcoin feature has been quarterly funding rounds for grants to public goods and open source projects that are accompanied with quadratic matching by sponsors.  That quadratic matching is designed to assess both the quantity and quality of support that a given project gets, creating an effective way of measuring dollar voting without descending into plutocracy.  These rounds, the energy and money they incubated for public goods, have been a great success for the Ethereum community in general.  Gitcoin has raised tens of millions of dollars through their GRs alone.

**How does Nouns DAO benefit?**


* **Fund the public goods from which we were created and on which are future depends.** Who's going to build the roads? We are.
* **Signal to the Ethereum, crypto, open source, and builder communities that our ethos aligns with theirs.**  We will be the one of largest matching partners, if not the #1. [The Ethereum Foundation is giving $500k specifically for the Advocacy category](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/16/advocacy-grants/) for example.
* **Make it normative for DAOs to support both crypto and real world public goods just as part of their DNA.**  Everyone benefits from this, it's a good seed for open source crypto and decentralized organizations, because we are and always will be all in this together.  We're leaders, let's lead.
* **Marketing to the types of creators and builders we want to attract for Nouns proposal that we are open for business.** Gitcoin projects have huge overlap with the types of projects and creators we would consider funding. It's a large gm to them all.
* **Demonstration that business should be sealed with NFT miscegenation and crossover events**. In this case, between Noun DAO's NFT and Gitcoin's.  Who knows what this type of NFT-rooted relationship could evolve into but there's memetic consistency in sealing a deal with an NFT crossover event.  Worst case, we have created more fun symbolically important art.  Best case it creates deeper ways to engage and collaborate with fellow DAOs or boomer organizations like Arby's.

**Moonshot Nouns**
* These will be 5 NFTs, made and managed on the Gitcoin side with input from the Nouns side.
* Will feature both Moonshot Bot and Nounish elements in some fashion.  Obviously, the most distinctive Nounish element are our glasses but there's also the distinctive heads which could be of use.  Artist may make a themed one for each category (Climate, Advocacy, Longevity, Ethereum) and then one uber-one. 
* The uber-one NFT will be auctioned on the 1st or 2nd of the round with an auction set to end on the 2nd to last day of the Round (December 11th).  Auction will be promoted on both Nouns and Gitcoin side. Proceeds will go to Gitcoin general fund or multisig.
* The category Moonshot Noun NFTs will be doled out to a champion from each category, determined by a process we run on the Nouns side.  Likely a small Nouns team will pick the top 10 projects in each category and then put it up for vote to the public. Potentially we can create a polling page on Nouns.wtf to drive engagement directly to our home rather than Twitter.  TBD.
* This is all subject to change if a better NFT crossover path and strategy emerge in process or it become unworkable.

**Steps and Timing**

1. Gitcoin principals and Nouns principals are spun up and planning. Completed.
2. Push Proposal onchain.
3. The grant to the Gitcoin multisig is straightforward and there's no execution issues with it other than passing a vote.  Late November.
4. Prelim NFT sketches have been made and that side is in process.
5. We will collaborate on a Gitcoin blog post that will go out at the launch of the round, and in conjunction with starting the auction for the uber-one Moonshot Noun on Opensea.  Nouns side will push the voting for projects starting midway through the round.  December 6th.
6. Voting concludes, Opensea auction concludes, we distribute the NFTs to the winners. December 12-13th.

23,Nouns Proposal Auction House,"# Nouns Proposal Auction House

### What is it?
Nouns Proposal Auction House (or Prop House) is an experimental approach to deploying capital: an auction of ETH where the bids placed are proxy NounsDAO proposals. At the end of each auction, Noun owners (Nouners) vote on which proposal gets funded.

This proposal aims to be the MVP for a trustless on-chain solution.

### Why?
The NounsDAO treasury is accruing capital at a $100M+ annual run rate. While NounsDAO has pushed several proposals through to execution, the current funding process does not seem like the optimal approach to scaling to thousands of projects. Prop House is an exploration of an alternative funding mechanism: forced treasury spend that minimizes friction to propose while maintaining quality via Nouns DAO member votes.

#### Forced treasury spend
If the underlying thesis behind Nouns DAO is that the more a meme is spread, the more its provenance is worth, then spending the treasury to proliferate Nouns 1 makes a lot of sense. Assuming there is ongoing supply of ideas to proliferate Nouns, Prop House aims to force perpetual spend to capture this supply.

#### Minimizing friction
Anyone who wants to build on Nouns 2 is encouraged to do so. To this end, there is documentation and guidance to help builders get funded as quickly as possible. Still, proposing to the DAO involves friction. It means joining a new community, proposing an idea, getting sponsorship, achieving community consensus and more. The process can take a week or more before proposing on-chain which takes yet another week. Prop House could alleviate some of this friction by redirecting focus to the proposal itself instead of other functions.

#### Quality
Assuming that being able to amass the significant amount of capital required to buy a Noun is correlated to being a good capital allocator, NounsDAO members represent a pool of intellectual capital that could be used as a quality filter for the best use of the Prop House auction funds.

### How would it work?
Funds requested from the DAO would be sent to a 2/3 safe controlled by cryptoseneca, devcarrot and Pixelz. The funds would be used to run three auctions of varying amounts and run times, for example:

* 5 ETH with a 7 day proposal and 3 day voting period.
* 10 ETH with a 14 day proposal and 3 day voting period.
* 20 ETH with a 21 day proposal and 3 day voting period.

The differing amounts and run times are to test which scale (if any) is best suited for the format.

A web app will be built as the home for the project where both auctions and voting will take place. Auctions will run for their allotted time, allowing anyone to bid with a proposal. The consecutive voting period will have Nouners vote for the proposal of their choice. At the end of the voting period, the funds will be transferred to the proposal with the most votes.

### Funds Requested
This proposal requests a total of 36 ETH from the DAO:

* 35 ETH to fund three auctions.
* 1 ETH for operational spend

### Who is behind this proposal?
seneca, one of the Nouns project founders. I will be building Prop House alongside devcarrot (Nounder) and Pixelz (designer) with help from the rest of the Nounders.

### Mock Up

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZRDauGe.png)


### Other Considerations
Prop House aims to be the MVP of a trustless on-chain solution. If the experiment succeeds, the next logical step would be to build an unopinionated suite of contracts that automate the process.

Conceptually, the contracts could be the seed to a crypto native Y Combinator model. Where as before you had partners, now you have DAO members. Instead of summer and winter batches, you have weekly or monthly cadences. And instead of demographic restrictions for applicants, you have anyone with an Ethereum wallet.

24,Noun Tracks - Unlocking the sounds of Nouns,"# Noun Tracks - Unlocking the sounds of Nouns


Authors: Arpeggi Labs, Nate Fox & Joshua Fisher.

## **TL;DR**
Noun Tracks are the fully on-chain 1:1 CC0 theme songs of a Noun created using Arpeggi Labs' on-chain DAW with samples and patterns performed and written by Nate Fox.

Together we will develop and launch Noun Tracks.  These NFT's are claimable for Nouners plus all the tools will be public and sounds will be compeletely CC0 for the community to enjoy.

## **How?**
### Part 1 - The Noun Track Stack
Nouns have a stack of visual characteristics that make them unique, with Noun Tracks now they have their own sounds too!

Noun Tracks contain a 1:1 sonic representation of every layer of a Noun. 

Each visible layer of the Noun corresponds to a unique component of the song:


**Layer 1 - Backgrounds (2)** - Key, either Major or Minor.

```
Key_Background {
    boolean major;
} 
```

**Layer 2 - Bodies (30)** - Chord Progressions containing unique Bass & Harmony patterns and samples. These correspond to the ""body"" of the song.

```
ChordProgression_Bodies {
	Pattern bass;
	Pattern harmony;
	Sample bassSample;
    Sample harmonySample;
}	
```

**Layer 3 - Accessories (137)** - Drum Loops containing unique snare, hat, percussion and kick patterns and samples. These provide a nice ""accessory"" to the other melodic components to the song.

```
DrumLoop_Accessory {
    Pattern kick.
    Pattern snare;
    Pattern hat;
    Pattern perc;
    Sample kickSample;
    Sample snareSample; 
    Sample hatSample;
    Sample percSample;
}
```

**Layer 4 - Heads (234)** - Lead Sample and Sound Effects. 234 Sample + Sound Effect combinations give each Noun. 
These custom Lead Samples plus fun FX Sample moments give each Noun Track a distinctive personality. For example, Nouns with the shark head will have a shark chomp sound effect!

```
FX_Heads {
    Sample lead;	
    Pattern fx;
    Sample fxSample;
} 
```

**Layer 5 - Glasses (21 patterns)** - Lead Pattern, aka the musical notation of the Lead Sample produced by Nate.

```
Lead_Glasses {
	Pattern lead;
}
```



### Part 2 - Construction of a Noun Track
Once an auction is settled and a new Noun appears a new Noun Track is created and minted! 

Using a custom ""Noun Track Creation Contract"" Arpeggi will pull the correspoding Samples and Patterns from the current Nouns features to create each days Noun Track. 

**Example Noun Track**

```
Noun_Track {
	Key_Background key;
    ChordProgression_Bodies chords;
    DrumLoop_Accessory drums;
    FX_Heads fx;
    Lead_Glasses lead;
}
```

(*please note that this was created using a BETA Version of Arpeggi Nouns where Percussion field was used or FX.  The final version will have greater flexibility)

### Part 3 - Minting & Distribution 

Every Noun has a corresponding Noun Track that can be claimed by the Noun owner. A Nouner simply connects the wallet to NounTracks.wtf and they can claim their corresponding Noun Track.

In addtion to the NFT being minted the Noun Track will be simultaneously uploaded w/ it's Noun artwork to the traditional music DSP's and platforms. Using a platform such as Revelator's on-chain IP rights management system the royalties generated will be split between NounsDAO, the Nouner, and the creators at 33.3% each. 

Don't worry if you don't own a Noun. All tools are public and the music is CC0 so feel free to have some fun!

This proposal corrects a protocol misconfiguration by updating the auction house proxy admin from the [NounsDAOExecutor](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0bc3807ec262cb779b38d65b38158acc3bfede10#code) contract to the [NounsAuctionHouseProxyAdmin](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC1C119932d78aB9080862C5fcb964029f086401e) contract.

This update is necessary because the admin of a transparent proxy is unable to call functions on the implementation contract. In this case, the implementation contract is the [NounsAuctionHouse](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf15a943787014461d94da08ad4040f79cd7c124e), which includes administrative functions such as `setTimeBuffer`, `setReservePrice`, and `setMinBidIncrementPercentage`.

The `NounsAuctionHouseProxyAdmin` is owned by the `NounsDAOExecutor` and is used as a dedicated interface to facilitate auction house proxy upgrades while maintaining the ability to call functions that exist on `NounsAuctionHouse`.",EXECUTED,13737934,13757644,0,12,,0,0,0,127,28,0,0,['0'],['0x830bd73e4184cef73443c15111a1df14e495c706'],['changeAdmin(address)'],13724794,1638412747,0xf6bcd6ac31d427fd0a5b2db7f6c990c7d5fc0e5f9f31f77fc1164fd77994fcce,['0x000000000000000000000000c1c119932d78ab9080862c5fcb964029f086401e'],0x83fcfe8ba2fece9578f0bbafed4ebf5e915045b9

TL;DR
Design, 3D print, and showcase worldwide a Nouns-inspired 3D-printed fashion collection.

I am inspired by Nouns to create my next 3D-printed fashion collection. The collection would use Nouns and their aesthetics as its leading design element. The 5-piece collection will contain 3D-printed textiles that would elegantly incorporate Nouns in their fabric.

As opposed to past collections in which I only used FDM (desktop printers) to make the entire collection, I am interested in incorporating more printing technologies to this collection. I want to test the boundaries of the latest printing tech, whether it be FDM, SLS, Polyjet etc. As with all my past work, the goal is to get the collection to be showcased in different tech conferences, fashion events, galleries, and museums.

I am a 3D printing fashion pioneer and my fashion collections have been showcased in all the top traditional media outlets worldwide ([NYT, WSJ, Bloomberg, BBC, The Guardian, Forbes, Vogue, ELLE, etc 1](https://danitpeleg.com/press/)) countless events (including the Rio opening ceremony at Paralympics and Mercedez-Benz fashion week), [museums](https://tinyurl.com/2p8zbz79), documentaries, newspapers, books. And my [TED talk](https://tinyurl.com/yck4y4y7) and other videos have received millions of views.

Liberty Leading the People Collection

**Why am I excited about this?**

This year began for me with unbounded excitement about the potential impact of NFTs on fashion, both physical and digital. I [experimented with minting some of my pieces](https://rarible.com/danitpeleg3d), bought different kinds of NFTs, and bonded with awesome artists (mainly female ones!). Ever since I heard about Nouns, I have been thinking about how I can bring my skills and know-how to contribute to Nouns' culture.

I came up with a few concepts like nouns' merch etc' but then I realized:

Nouns can help me **push my creative and technical boundaries to bring the most innovative fashion collection to life**, and I can help **proliferate Nouns to new audiences!**

With Nouns' funding, I can spend the next few months working on what I love the most (making 3D-printed fashion, pushing the boundaries of the possible with the current technology). And with the result - a uniquely wearable Nounish 3D-printed fashion collection - Nouns and NounsDAO story can proliferate and get known with new audiences (like, more women, 3d printing enthusiasts, digital fashionistas, fashion students, and more!)

**How will the collection proliferate Nouns?**

I wanted to touch on this because it's the key question: how will people hear about this? how will this get attention?

My two last big collections, the 2015 [""Liberty Leading the People"" 1](https://tinyurl.com/yt6dj264) and the 2017 [""Birth of Venus](https://danitpeleg.com/the-birth-of-venus/)"", both received incredible amounts of press coverage. Why? because they both had strong underlying stories. The Liberty collection was a ""first"" - it was the first 3D printed fashion collection printed entirely at home, and the Birth collection was based on the 3D printed dress I [made for the Paralympics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcvYRjWdfyU), and also it contained the first commercially available [3D printed jacket](https://danitpeleg.com/product/create-your-own-3d-printed-jacket/).

The Nouns + Innovative tech + Fashion angle will surely fascinate many. A good story will be crafted, and I am sure that this collection will get a lot of attention because it is touching on all the most fascinating topics of our times: cryptoculture, 3D printing, digital fashion, AR etc'

**So, what are the phases required to produce a 3D-printed fashion collection?**

1.  **Research** - Inspiration board, material research, printing samples
2.  **Design** - sketches (and more sketches)
3.  **Modeling** - 3D modeling the sketches into 3D-printable files (working with **zeeraffe)**
4.  **Print testing** - testing many different types of printers, configurations, materials etc
5.  **Printing finals** - printing the entire collection
6.  **Assembling** - using different techniques (e.g. gluing, knotting, etc) to assemble the collection together
7.  **Photoshoot** (with real-life models) - for press materials, websites, AR filter etc
8.  **Runway show** - either invited to showcase at an event like nft.nyc, fashion weeks etc'
9.  **Marketing** - prepare press kit, the collection get PR, is booked for events, and showcases galleries & museums

**Budget & next steps**

To kickoff phases 1+2, I am asking **3.15 ETH** so I can commit to start the creative process, defining the technology I need to use as well as developing a detailed budget.

**Deliverables for this first phase:**
* Creating a full sketchbook of what I envision the collection will look like
* A robust budget for phases 4-9 that can then be presented to the community for feedback.

Just to give a sense of the sizing of this project to reduce uncertainty --- and it really all depends on the type of technologies we will use for printing (e.g. polyjet is MUCH more expensive than FDM) --- I estimate a full fashion collection can be done for **$80K-150K.**

*A bit more about me:*
I’m a 3D printed fashion designer. I recently filed 2 patents about soft 3D printable materials. I believe that 3D printing opens up fascinating new opportunities in fashion, combined with the power of NFTs my vision of downloading and printing clothes is closer than ever.

In 2018, I was recognized as one of Europe’s Top Women in Tech by Forbes. In 2019, the BBC named me as one of the 100 most inspiring and influential women in the world. In 2021 I opened the first 3D printable fashion NFTs store. I was fascinated to learn about the nouns movement and want to contribute so I can learn more about how the DAO is operating from first hand. I’m passionate about making this innovative collection inspired by the cool nouns!

## Who is behind this proposal?

**[cdt.eth ](https://twitter.com/cdt_eth) -** [Christian ](https://twitter.com/cdt_eth) is a software engineer who has worked on the [Nouns POAP](https://nounspoap.com/) team, created [ToadzToolz ](https://toadztoolz.com/) for Cryptoadz, and [SharkDAO’s ](https://sharkdao.community/) website as well as the forthcoming SharkDAO PFP project and a secret Nouns project with [12BNoun ](https://twitter.com/12bnoun). He’s also opened some PRs on https://nouns.wtf/ and has been an early-supporter of Nouns.

## What is it?

[Nouns Center ](https://twitter.com/NounsCenter) ([nouns.center ](https://nouns.center/)) will be a home for the Nouns community. The hope is to document all existing creators & projects, and help people discover the hundreds of new ones that will launch in the future. I did something similar with the Cryptoadz community by creating [ToadzToolz.com ](https://toadztoolz.com/toolz), but that was mainly to showcase projects. Whereas my vision for Nouns Center is to serve the community in 3 main ways.

**1. Knowledge Center**

* Brand & product design resources
* A traditional help center
* Responses from Nounders to FAQs

**2. Project Aggregator**

* showcase all projects built off Nouns
* prove the power & track scale of CC0
* inspire more art & derivatives

**3. Onboarding Ramp**

* help others use Nouns in projects
* explain Nouns buying process
* submitting proposals

**Whether you want to buy a Noun, create a derivative, contribute to the codebase, or submit a proposal, this information should be clear and immediately accessible to you.**

## Video Explainer

Here is a pitch from Christian to Seneca on the idea, for anyone who might prefer to hear him talk through his vision for Nouns World.

![|480x360](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/42dff306eeea9c1a85fba96e594b5376276dbaab.jpeg ""Nouns Center"")

[Nouns Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rDpYBeOpM8)

# 1) **Knowledge Center**

I will compile all Noun trait files, fonts, logos, colors hex values etc in one place to help people get up and running to build with Nouns. Until the forthcoming Design System is released, which can also live on this site. Imagine simply visiting [ `https://nouns.center/assets` ](https://nouns.center/assets) and finding everything you need to work and create with Nouns. Whether that be PNGs for artists or links to the folder on Github. The answers to all questions asked should be one link away.

![i|450x372](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/68dd2750be337c655a27f75d160b1ff6425f6c53.png)

My second pitch is to the Nounders to open their Discussions forum feature on [the monorepo ](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo) to begin to capture all the answers they give to user questions every day. I added some example categories below to help visualize this. We could break up question types be category and begin to collect dozens of questions & answers in each section. The Nounders have spent a ton of time answering every question imaginable and very thoroughly, on a daily basis and I want to give them their time back. It will be some work up front to get the Discussions content up and running, but to have a technical content repository would be invaluable.

![a](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/f99536abdd4a03261d7e5a13aab4c52a0fbaad5f.png)

Github Discussions is free, comes with Search built-in, and the Nounders are Github-native. My plan is to fetch this data and bring it into the site. Imagine, if someone has a question they could simply visit [https://nouns.center/dev ](https://nouns.center/) to find all these answers, and I would fetch the data on this new site because artist and non-devs could benefit as well. Those who don’t have a Github account nor would ever go to the Developer channel on Discord could simply go to [https://nouns.center/artist ](https://nouns.center/) to find questions answered already about where to find assets, how to compose a Nouns, canvas dimensions etc.

It will snowball once the infrastructure is in place.
Questions will be asked once, and linked forever.

# 2) Project Aggregator

I’ve aggregated every piece of Nouns content (so far) that I could find in [this spreadsheet. ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QlE93Uv4L3pTOPmrgLvr1NinPDB6atQ_ZbbU6vkHmXs/edit?usp=sharing)

It’s a lot. We’ve done a lot. I want to showcase all this effort.

![r](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/71224aa3e3eadc1c68f37dee22632c5707ab51bb.jpeg)

Imagine going to [ `https://nouns.center/projects` ](https://nouns.center/) and being able to see and access every single derivative, podcast episode, proposal project, YouTube video, and news story about Nouns. We should have a one-stop-shop for that as well. It should be compelling visually and truly highlight the power of CC0 and our community. We’ll highlight creators and link to their profiles as well. I’ll create a backlog submission system so we can capture user-submitted projects to streamline the process of getting added to the site. I did this with [https://toadztoolz.com/ideaz ](https://toadztoolz.com/ideaz).

I want to inspire the next hundred projects to spawn out of Nouns,
and we’ll be ready to give them the tools to do so.

# 3) Onboarding Ramp

Lastly, I’d like to reduce as much friction as possible with people understanding the concepts & processes of NounsDAO. I’d like to find an artist to help with create some infographics about some key aspects of Nouns to help explain concepts like Proposals (How to Submit, Criteria, Timeline, and Payment), the Auction & Settlement process, buying a Noun = 1 vote in Dao, cloning & getting the Nouns webapp running locally for devs etc etc. There’s plenty of room to play with here, and yes, all these questions can be answered by a long paragraph of copy, but I loved what The Oracle did with the Proposal infographic.

![h](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/91dea0df191f4f42c0f030955f4ae66108b32e22.jpeg)

and SharkDAO has an excellent one explaining its role within the NounsDAO. I believe these things work and they help solidify the concepts for folks. Plus it adds an air of Nouns both high-quality and creatively capable.

![b](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/53d2efcd3848707f471b3281f91f68d1d62c9a90.png)

Make the unknowns, known.
Let builders get back to building.

## Where Does This Go?

Some random thoughts where this could go in the future:

* integrate Nouns official Design System?

28,Send a Noun to the International Space Station,"# Send a Noun to the International Space Station

I’ve been speaking to a space company (name is confidential) that sends cargo up to the International Space Station (ISS) and assigns tasks (such as experiments) to astronauts on board. I’d like to propose sending a 3d printed Noun to the ISS. This would be the first time a crypto or NFT character has ever traveled in space, and would generate a lot of publicity and forever be part of Nouns lore. The memes that can be generated from this event would be endless. With this project, Nouns DAO would be pushing the boundary of what crazy things can be achieved by DAOs.

DANIT will design and 3D print the Noun to be delivered into space. She will send it to the company, where it will put the figurine through a variety of tests to make sure it is safe for entering space. 

Noun 22 will provide governance and an extra pair of eyes on all communications with the company to make sure everything is done above board. 

Launch will occur sometime in H2 2022. The Noun will get sent up on a Space X (or similar) rocket to the ISS. Astronauts will take a picture of the Noun, with various backgrounds such as the inside of the space station and the window looking out on the Earth. These pictures would be sent to us and circulated in traditional and social media. We could choose to pay extra to deliver the Noun safely back to Earth, or pay less to dispose of it in however way NASA usually disposes of stuff. 

We have the proposal from the company and if this is approved, I would personally enter into a contract with the company to begin this project, and use the ETH from the DAO to pay USD deposits on the work. Here is the budget:

Design and printing of Noun plus shipping costs  (by DANIT) - 1 ETH
Project management (by Noun 53), consisting of 1+ years of calls and emails with the company, and reviewing proposals and contracts - 5 ETH
Pre-launch testing, launch, and return - 20 ETH
Booked NASA astronaut time - 37 ETH
Total - 63 ETH

Timeline:
Mid Dec - Proposal voted on and contract signed
Jan 2022 - Initial deposit paid
Feb 2022 - printing and shipping of Noun completed
Mar - Jun 2022 - testing of Noun and waiting for launch to happen
Mid to late 2022 - launch to be scheduled and picture to be taken on ISS.

34,100 DAYS OF NOUNS (Coloring Book Series),"# 100 DAYS OF NOUNS (Coloring Book Series)

Proposal by Messhup, submit on-chain by Noun 22

![](https://i.imgur.com/N3MgnVt.jpg)

**Why Coloring Books?**

* It expands the current crypto native zone to a more mainstream audience.
* All characters incentivize exploration, curiosity, or time for playing and learning.
* Foster creativity and well being, improve focus and relieve stress.
* Can create family bonding time if the activity is shared with relatives.
* It makes co-creators, people who paint them will make their own version of the page.
* Could prepare and draw the attention of the next generation of artists who want to make spin-offs based on Nouns.


**A Coloring book series.**

* 30 days of Nouns (round 1, 2, 3).
* 100 days of Nouns, a fourth book bundling up the past 3 versions plus the remaining nouns and bonus pages between all of them to divide the whole series inside the book and keep it organized.
* 100 unique hand-drawn pages depicting the life of each Noun.

![](https://i.imgur.com/SDA9WPK.jpg)

30 days of Nouns consists of 30 hand-drawn “mandalas” for a coloring book including 30 nouns per book plus a couple of bonus pages that can be painted as well. Additionally, each book will explain what NounsDAO is, what’s the main purpose of the community and the goal of the organization.

**Coloring pages examples:**
These pages are finalized and they are a true copy from the books.
![](https://i.imgur.com/HxGGsES.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/4c4hBBH.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/izeKVr3.jpg)


All pages are going to be free to download (high resolution .jpg and/or PDF format) from the main site of the collection I’m working on (Nounsense.wtf)

**Physical Books:**

A physical book will be developed to be printed on demand through Amazon and expand even further the public of Nouns. These physical books will be designed and packaged for convenience purposes (it could be gifted to friends and/or family members around the world, avoiding the hassle of print all the pages and dealing with logistics by themselves)

**Estimated delivery time:**

The book cover of the first book (Round 1) is already finished alongside its 30 pages, but I’m polishing small details like formatting and editing.
I’m currently developing the second round of the series (book 2).  
The first book will be published at the end of January like I mentioned in Discourse (Although I’m highly tempted to use February 2nd as a special date to publish it), but it could be discussed with Nouners/Nounders.

**Publishing schedule**

![](https://i.imgur.com/z2JVvZC.jpg)

**Funds Requested**

The total amount for the project is 22ETH
* 11 ETH up-front
* 11 ETH when the fourth book is finished and published.

Every book will require 6.5ETH (Except the 100 pages version: 2.5ETH)
0.2ETH per coloring page + 0.4ETH for the cover and bonus pages.
0.1ETH for design, formatting and editing.

This proposal also includes a 0.13 ETH gas reimbursement for submitting the on-chain proposal.


**Who’s Messhup?**

I’m a Graphic Designer / Illustrator. I’ve collaborated with brands like Adidas UK, ExxonMobil, Penguin Random House, and Goliath Games in the past 6 years of my career.
I’ve collaborated with amazing people in web3 like [Noadz](https://twitter.com/thenoadz/status/1462296582292787205/photo/1) , [CreatureToadz](https://twitter.com/CreatureToadz/status/1465823699769212933) and of course NounsDAO.

**About my collaboration with Nouns:**

I’ve developed 10 coloring pages for NounsDAO under the small grants and retrofunding pool. After the 10th page, NounsDAO made a coloring contest where everyone had the opportunity to paint and send multiple entries. The contest was a huge success and there were a lot of people who even recruited family members to join the party. 

In the following link you can check the winners and finalists:

At last but not least, I have to thank Noun22 for all the amazing support, help and guidance on this since the beginning! Without him this whole project couldn’t be done. I’m always open to community feedback, thanks for taking the time reading this.

**Nouns Outdoor Advertising Placement On Giant Donut Statue In Los Angeles (Randy’s Donuts)**

Proposal by Plutus Media & WOW Media
Proposal submit on-chain by Noun 22

**Summary**: Nounify a giant 32 foot landmark donut statue in Los Angeles with Nouns glasses. The donut is on top of Randy’s Donuts in Ingelwood, California.

**Placement**: Fabricate & Place Nouns Glasses On Randy’s Donut

**Renderings**:

![](https://i.imgur.com/JUYEIIF.jpg)

**Contributor Info**: My name is Josh and I own Plutus Media, a full service marketing agency based in NYC. In collaboration with a Los Angeles based business partner, WOW Media, I am proposing this unique outdoor placement for the Nouns! I am able to place media on Randy’s Donuts, a landmark donut shop in Inglewood, CA. Maybe you’ve seen it featured in Iron Man 2 when Tony Stark was eating a donut in the Iron Man suit on the donut.

**Where**?: Randy’s Donuts- 805 W Manchester Blvd, Inglewood, CA 90301

**When**?: Based on time to go live, the placement is available the entire month of March. So any week within March can be reserved.

My goal for this is to present the Nouns with a unique and viral outdoor advertising opportunity worthy of the DAO and Nouns brand. Something that everyone will talk about, share, and appreciate.

This outdoor placement is in true Nouns style, and not the typical Times Square NFT placement. The donut is also illuminated when the sun is down, so the donut will always be visible since Randy’s is open 24/7. The placement can be live for up to 3 weeks.

This Nouns glasses placement involves fabricating an over 30 foot pair of Nouns glasses and placing them directly in front of Randy’s Donut. Glasses will be fabricated using an aluminum frame with fabric, vinyl or mesh stretched over the frame to match artwork. Randy’s Donuts does not allow anything to puncture the donut statue, so the only option is having these glasses sit on a discreet frame.


**Turnaround Time To Going Live (Post Payment & Receiving Creative)**: Up to 4 Weeks


**Nouns Glasses Pricing Breakdown**:
Glasses Fabrication + Install + Hardware= $35,000 (Additional Equipment Rental Fee Of $600/Week)
Donut Rental Per Week= $27,000

1 Week Live: $62,000 USD 

**Proposal Transactions**:
To account for price fluctuations of Ethereum, this proposal includes a transaction to send 30 ETH to the Nouns DAO Retroactive Funding and Small Grants Pool.  If the proposal passes, Small Grants will send the ETH equivalent $62,000 to Josh at Plutus Media.

This proposal also includes a 0.10 ETH gas reimbursement for submitting the on-chain proposal.

Submitting this Proposal in collaboration with Lily, Development Director for The Skatepark Project

Who is behind this proposal?
Founded by Tony Hawk, The Skatepark Project (TSP) is a nonprofit organization working to increase access to outdoor recreation and free play through the creation of safe and inclusive community skateparks. TSP provides the resources, advocacy skills, grants and fellowship programs that guide skaters in creating their own community skateparks, from conception through construction. This is a collaborative process between skaters and city authorities to invest in capital improvements that will enrich a community for decades. The Skatepark Project’s grant programs have awarded over $10 million to help fund nearly 700 public skateparks in all 50 States, enjoyed by an estimated 6 million people annually. The organization’s International Program has provided technical and financial support to assist youth through the Skateistan educational programs in Afghanistan, Cambodia, and South Africa. To get involved, visit https://skatepark.org/

What is it?
apenoun/Oni will facilitate a design contest for the artwork and The Skatepark Project will source and facilitate the creation of 300 complete skateboards with the winning art to be given away to kids who would not otherwise be able to afford a skateboard. We'll also plan to have stickers available for the kids!

- Design Contest
Nouners to run a contest selecting 10 community submitted designs to be printed on the boards.
- TSP to source custom decks with Nouners winning art + hardware and skate tools for 300 complete boards
- Facilitate Build: TSP will organize volunteers or paid labor to assemble 300 skateboard
- Give Away Event: TSP will organize a small local event at a public skatepark to give-away the 300 complete skateboards. This event will take place only if be public health guidelines permit. The boards will be given away in Southern California.

Funding:
This proposal requests a total of 23.72 ETH up front from the DAO to fund the entire project.

- 12.60 ETH: Parts and Tools for 300 skateboards (wholesale cost + shipping) [TSP]
- 7.69 ETH: Donation to the The Skate Park Foundation [TSP]
- 1.93 ETH: Events & Coordination (parts ordering, volunteer board build and board give away) [TSP]
- 1.00 ETH: Skate Deck Contest Prize Money (10 x .10 ETH) [Oni]
- 0.5 ETH: Oversight, Design & Supply die-cut vinyl stickers, Gas [Oni]

Timeline:
We expect this process to take ~3 months . We will communicate milestone goals throughout the project and provide detailed dates as they are solidified.

Milestones: Design contest, deck manufacturer, board assembly, give away event

1. Reporting on deliverables for my initial proposal (milestones 1+2)
2. New proposal for milestones 3+4
3. Potential opportunity with Metaverse fashion week

# Reporting on the progress on my initial proposal


### I have completed milestones #1 and #2 (Research + Design) for which I got funded in my [initial proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/26).

### Here’s the final sketch for the collection’s 7 outfits, each of them inspired by a different noun which I liked:

### I have also started testing prints (milestone #4), which I think the community has been really excited about (check out this Twitter[ thread](https://twitter.com/danitpeleg3d/status/1486019979879358466)!):

## Roadmap & Progress:

1. ☑ **Research** - Inspiration board, material research, printing samples
2. ☑ **Design** - sketches
3. **STARTED**: **Patternmaking/Rendering/Modeling** - 3D modeling the sketches into 3D-printable files
4. **STARTED**: **Print Testing** - testing many different types of printers, configurations, materials etc
5. **-> NEW (potential) milestone: Participate in Metaverse Fashion Week (MVFW)**
6. **Printing finals** - printing the entire collection
7. **Assembling** - using different techniques (e.g. gluing, knotting, etc) to assemble the collection together
8. **Photoshoot** (with real-life models) - for press materials, websites, AR filter etc
9. **Runway show** - either invited to showcase at an event like nft.nyc, fashion weeks etc'
10. **Marketing** - prepare press kit, the collection get PR, is booked for events, and showcases galleries & museums

### 3DP research

I have a partnership with a lab where we create all kind of filaments for 3D-printing textiles. We will be developing special filaments for the collection’s color palette. More on this in the next update!

# New proposal for: milestone 3+4 - Patternmaking, Rendering & Modeling, as well as continued Print Testing

I am working with 3 different experts for this part of the project:
* **Patternmaking**: I have partnered with [Optitex](https://optitex.com/), a leading fashion design software company, who are working with me on patternmaking for the colleciton free of charge.
* **Modeling**: I am working with a very talented modeler to turn my sketches and the patterns into 3D files that are printable. 
* **Rendering**: I am working with a brilliant 3D designer to create beautiful renderings of the collection, to be used in the Metaverse, or with potential 3D-printable NFTs, and generally to market the collection in the digital realm.

**Here is an example of what a model looks like (these files will be used for 3D printing):**

Here's the budget for these milestones: 

* **Modeling 7 outfits (15 items):** 7 ETH
* **Rendering 7 outfits (15 items)**: 2.3 ETH
* **Prints tests**: 1 ETH
* **My work (around 3 months)** 7.6 ETH
* **Total** = 17.9 ETH

This would bring the project up to now to a total spend of 21.05 ETH (3.15 + 17.9), which is approx $63K in USD value. I now expect the total cost of the project to be around $100-150K, depending on printing costs and marketing costs (mainly photoshoot/runway).

Thank you all for the support. This must be one of the most exciting projects I have worked on!

44,Nouns Acquisition Committee,"# Nouns Acquisition Committee

## Create new workstream: Nouns Acquisition Committee
The DAO has socially signaled a desire to acquire Nouns, either in the treasury or on-demand, for a variety of potential use cases including:
- experiment with fractional ownership/governance protocols
- provide collateral to one or more NFT lending facilities
- add option to transfer Nouns as part of proposal transactions

We propose the creation of the Nouns Acquisition Committee workstream: a group comprised of Nouners who facilitate the purchase and distribution of Nouns on behalf of the DAO. This approach allows the DAO to acquire Nouns in stages as needed and avoid many of the negative externalities expressed by Nouners.

## Other approaches and issues
1. Buy from secondary
    * net loss of ETH to the treasury
    * easily gamed by secondary market participants
2. Mint directly to the treasury
    * navigate technical and execution risks of swapping out the NounsAuctionHouse implementation
    * potential brand damage around increasing the Noun supply by more than 1 per day

## Workstream mandates
attempt to acquire up to 3 Nouns from the daily public auction
for any given auction do not exceed 20% of average settle price of the last three (3) auctions
hold the (3) Nouns in the workstream multisig and delegate votes to the Nouncil
as uses materialize, allocate Nouns from the multisig for these purposes at the discretion of the committee
once all Nouns are allocated request funding for acquiring more Nouns

45,Retain builder to work on nouns.wtf for 6 months,"# Retain builder to work on nouns.wtf for 6 months

Proposal by brianj, submitted on-chain by Noun 22

### TLDR

I have been the Nouns DAO engineering resident for the last 3 months (funded under Prop 17) and I requesting a 6 month continuation of my residency.

### What I did during Prop 17

My residency under Prop 17 had the following goals:

1. Update the UX of the auction page and integrate it with the Noun profile pages
2. Update the UX of the governance page
3. Update the UX of the proposal page

I achieved all of these goals during Prop 17. In addition, I also took it upon myself to do the following:

1. Created the (recently revamped) nounsstats.wtf page which provides insight into Noun rarity and Noun Governance participation
2. Created (pro bono) a bot to automatically create snapshot votes for Shark DAO based on the creation of new on-chain Nouns DAO proposals
3. Helped automate parts of Bidder POAP
4. Review PRs for nouns.wtf

### What I will do during my next residency

I have two main goals for my next residency:

#### Continue to maintain nouns.wtf

I will be taking on more of an ownership role of nouns.wtf going forward. This means that in addition to reviewing inbound PRs, I will be responsible for ongoing bug fixes and improvements. 

One particular task to call out as part of improvements is getting to a few UI details that we didn't have time for during Prop 17 (ex: bid history modal).

#### Make nouns.wtf more robust, extensible, and contributor friendly

1. Revamp CI / CD pipeline to allow easy deploy to prod (process right now is very manual)
2. Add real time error monitoring so we can rollback bad changes quickly with minimal negative user impact
3. Generally improve code quality and documentation of the codebase to make it more contributor friendly (in particular, documentation around our Github processes to make it easier for new contributors to onboard)
4. Refactor nouns.wtf to use a nouns component library to allow people to easily build on our “look and feel”
5. Localize nouns.wtf to increase the reach of our brand to non-english audiences 
6. Security audit to assess risk and patch any potential exploits should they exist

### Proposed workflow

I propose the following framework for tracking my progress and giving the DAO visibility into my work. 

#### Monthly updates

I will give monthly written updates to the DAO. These will be akin to investor update emails.
They will include:
1. What did I say I was going to get done last month
2. What of that did I actually get done
3. What am I committing to getting done in the coming month

#### Project scoping docs

For every distinct project I take on, I will write a short scoping doc (1-2 pages) which I will share with the community for visibility (either on Discord or Github). In this context one project roughly equals one bullet point in the section of my goals (ex: localize nouns.wtf would be one project).

These scoping docs will include the following information:
1. Project goals (project must do x, should do y)
2. Project non-goals (what, if anything, is explicitly out of scope)
3. High level description of technical aspects of proposed change
4. Project milestones with ETAs

#### Github projects + Discord
In addition to tracking progress at the project level, I will continue to use Github issues, Github projects, and frequent updates to the Nounders (in a private project Discord channel) to promote accountability and give the DAO visibility into my daily work. 


### Proposed compensation

I propose that I am compensated 62.52414 ETH over 6 months (10.42069 ETH per month distributed via a Sablier stream).

I think this is a fair rate for 2 reasons:
1. 22's recent proposal passed at this rate. We were both previously funded by Prop 17
2. This rate is fairly in line (in fact a bit lower) on an annualized + USD converted basis with what I was making in my previous normie tech job / what I was offered by normie tech companies when I recently interviewed (~4 months ago)



### Closing thoughts

I believe that over the last 3 months, I've show that I can execute with little oversight and generate value for the DAO (in excess of original project scope). I have greatly enjoyed building with all of you over the last 3 months and hope you will give me the opportunity to continue with you on this great journey.",EXECUTED,14452235,14471945,0,24,,0,0,0,249,61,0,0,"['62524140000000000000', '0', '0']","['0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2', '0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2', '0xcd18eaa163733da39c232722cbc4e8940b1d8888']","['deposit()', 'approve(address,uint256)', 'createStream(address,uint256,address,uint256,uint256)']",14439095,1647991716,0x0ad62eb61a3a578f123429abeccc26fe5cd47394cb5244615d9bd2b8b562f105,"['0x', '0x000000000000000000000000cd18eaa163733da39c232722cbc4e8940b1d888800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000363b25e101acac000', '0x000000000000000000000000a1c0b11b86a46885b87c7ed68b91faa0c349e1cd00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000363b25e101acac000000000000000000000000000c02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006247920000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000633bb600']",0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e
46,Marketplace Pod Proposal,"# Marketplace Pod Proposal

## Goal

Create a Nouns marketplace for originals and extension projects.

## Why?

* Create a free marketplace for secondary sales of Nouns.
* Facilitate the exentions ecosystem: make it easier to search and discover the Nouns ecosystem.

Build distribution for the NounsDAO: build community and liquidity that NounsDAO can use to potentially curate in the future.

## Considerations

* 0% fees
* No official endorsement of derivatives
* Linked to from nouns.wtf header
* Feels nounish in branding and aesthetic
* Entirely open source
* Low barrier to entry for derivatives to be added to the marketplace
* This will be manually operated to start and managed by the marketplace pod.
* We can work on an automated and more trustless way to recognize derivatives and get closer to permissionless listings.

## Budget

50 ETH for 6 months of marketplace pod operations

## Milestones

* Design sign off from community
* 2-4 weeks initial development time
* Deployed at nouns.town domain (need to confirm)
* Marketplace launch with initial batch of derivatives
* Offchain orders
* Add in Daily Nouns Auction experience
* Automated derivative addition
* [Stretch]: Aggregate other marketplaces
* [Stretch]: Enable swaps

## Create new workstream: Nouns Events Committee

The DAO has socially signaled a desire to organize IRL events.  These events can serve a variety of purposes, such as:

- bringing together nouners in various cities around the world
- sponsoring events organized by derivative communities & other nounish SubDAOs
- sponsoring larger events to help proliferate the Nouns in distinct communities, globally

We propose the creation of the Nouns Events Committee - a group of dedicated Nouners who facilitate the organization, coordination, and funding of various events organized by members within the community and at large.  We will follow a proposal based approach to ensure that events funded are well planned and well executed.  We will be publicly sharing these proposals to ensure transparency of use of funds, purpose of events, and more.

### Committee Mandates

- Planning strategic direction for events to be organized over the coming months
- Fielding event proposals from the community to engage the community and inspire creativity
- Helping iterate and provide feedback on event proposals to ensure strong implementation plans, accountable timelines, and transparent budgets
- Allocating funds to event proposals that are aligned with Nouns mission and greater community
- Sharing periodic updates on successes and areas of improvement
- Routinely engaging with community to level up key event champions (i.e. rewarding contributors that are highly engaged with the Nouns Events Committee)
- Bringing the Nouns community together, IRL ⌐◨-◨

Dustin Yellin proposes the creation of PERSON, PLACE or THING, a new 6 foot tall sculpture as part of his on-going series, Psychogeographies.

https://www.dustinyellin.com/d/24141e#cover

The entire set of Nouns minted before July 22, 2022 will be rendered in their distinctive style within the layers of the artwork, to form and populate the landscape of a giant human figure.

The physical sculpture will be paired with an NFT created by Yellin for the project.

Upon completion, Yellin will loan the physical artwork to exhibitions for the next 3 years minimum.

The compensation for PERSON, PLACE or THING is 100ETH to the artist (50ETH upon acceptance of the proposal, and 50ETH upon completion of the artwork in a separate proposal), a donation of 100,000 USDC (in rough ETH equivalent) to Pioneer Works (https://pioneerworks.org/), and 1 Noun NFT (Noun 252 from the Nouns treasury).

50,Donate 51 ETH for humanitarian aid to Ukraine through the Rescue Toadz project,"#  Donate 51 ETH for humanitarian aid to Ukraine through the Rescue Toadz project

## Summary
Donate 51 ETH for humanitarian aid to Ukraine through the Rescue Toadz (https://rescuetoadz.xyz/) project and incentivize people to donate more.

## Methodology
Rescue Toadz is an NFT collection of 18 toadz in which 100% of the funds are donated to Ukraine via Unchain Ukraine (directly coded in the smart contract). The project has a special bidding mechanic that encourages people to donate more.

The interesting thing is that you can not only mint toadz, but also match or increase the last donation for an already minted toad and it will automatically be transferred into your wallet. The toad will then drop its noun glasses as POAP in the wallet of the original holder.

This mechanism is coded directly in the smart contract and a toad owner cannot prevent the toad from hopping into another wallet. The idea is that this will encourage people to donate more. If they want to keep their toad they need to increase the price of the donation or acquire back the toad if somebody donated more.

### Why not donate directly to Unchain?

The idea is to gamify the donation experience so people will donate more. For example, NounsDAO can donate for already minted toadz and “steal” them from the previous owners. Some of them will then donate again to get their toad back.

The goal of the proposal is to donate 0.2 ETH for 5 toadz that are already minted and “steal” them from the previous owners and also raise the prices for two other toadz to 10 ETH and 40 ETH respectively.

### Transactions

The following transactions shall be executed if the proposal is approved:

Donate 5x 0.2 ETH for Rescue Toadz #2, #5, #6, #11 and #16
Donate 10 ETH for Rescue Toad #15
Donate 40 ETH for Rescue Toad #8

## Conclusion
Donating 51 ETH through the Rescue Toadz project has the following benefits:

Funds raised by NounsDAO to help Ukrainian people recover from the war
Raised popularity of the Rescue Toadz charity project, so more people start donating
People that had their Rescue Toad taken from them are incentivized to get it back by donating again.

**Background: [Nouns Athletes](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-nouns-athletes/731)** received 3 ETH in funding from Small Grants for a proof of concept. We secured our first signing, [Joe Atkinson](https://www.instagram.com/joeatkinsons), who is currently working on his first Nounish production.

This proposal aims to facilitate a co-op between [Nouns Athletes](https://twitter.com/nounsathletes) and [Gnars](https://gnars.wtf), a community of action sports enthusiasts ready to expand beyond skateboarding, to all extreme sports.

**Gnars DAO** is a natural progression for a project that’s well positioned to help extreme athletes reach the people, places and things that bring out their best – ultimately proliferating Nouns.

## TL;DR

**Extreme sports DAO tasked with…**

1. Managing a Nouns DAO funded and decentralised treasury
2. Sponsoring athletes with grants for travel and content creation
3. Making production, merch, event and protocol decisions

**Requesting 69 ETH** for Gnars DAO to steward an expansion of Nouns Athletes with travel sponsorships across various target disciplines.

ie. Gnars DAO (enthusiasts) proliferating Nouns DAO (professionals)...

## Sub-DAOs

Nouns DAO inherently [faces a number of challenges](https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1511601988915523585) around ideation and capital deployment, due to the broadness of application that comes with such an ambitious project.

![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/336a6169a8e534d0e5a38077c5ea7b24a1cfc1d2_2_690x357.png)

As of 22 March 2022, Nouns DAO has:
* Received 23,421 ETH
* Sent 4,784 ETH
    * Staked 3,000 in Lido
    * Spent 458 on Foundation setup and ops

**Only 1,326 ETH has been spent on directly proliferating Nouns,** which represents **just 5.66% of total funding raised,** most of which is not visible on the chart above.

Sub-DAOs may address the deal flow problems faced by a generalist organisation such as Nouns, by operating as an intermediary for impactful and domain specific capital deployment.

![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/192fa943b3337ed1990092839abbdadd1b181009_2_690x288.png)

Gnars began as a simple experiment to see how people value team contributions versus allocation of funds toward meaningful and well aligned charitable causes. As expected, collectors want to see what the future holds and therefore tend toward adequately funding a team – tested using a [Humble Bundle inspired](https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/204387088-Pay-What-You-Want-and-Contribution-Sliders) contribution slider.

![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/3e838186abf3c575e92ffe393b44445d749b2258_2_690x239.png)

But perhaps more abstractly, the project was intended to serve as a dip of the toe, to understand whether I personally, should “Skate or DAO?” Having quickly attracted a community of talented and passionate individuals, I’ve discovered that the answer is unequivocally “DAO.”

Connecting with the community has helped me to understand that we are uniquely positioned for experimentation. As a laser focused sub-DAO we can recruit and grow an extreme sports team through fan engagement. 

I’m proposing a domain specific sub-DAO structure **– a *SHRED*.**

## Gnars DAO

Skate or DAO -> Shred the Nouns 🤘

Gnars aims to operate as a ***Streamlined Hierarchical Really Excellent DAO (SHRED)*** and while the name is a stretch, the concept of ‘shredding the nouns’ can be hyper-focused and impactful.

The structure allows for off-chain voting with on-chain execution, without dependence on a single centralised entity. This hybrid model is more accessible since individual voters won’t need to pay gas. But it’s also an adequately secure means of sub-DAO treasury stewardship.

## 0xigami and co.

My team will continue full-time delivery of new and existing ecosystem projects, as funded by bidders setting what portion of their winning bids go to team vs DAO.

Funding provided by team for maintenance and development expenses is also in our best interest, while acquiring Gnars and Nouns and proliferating the Nouniverse.

While having a sizeable vested interest in Nouns and a strong alignment with CC0 principles, it’s also in my best interest to ensure Gnars is net-additive above all.

### Noun 189

[Gnars DAO community](https://discord.gg/cCR49gTksw) will have the ability to participate in Nouns governance as their Gnar NFTs will each represent a vote toward execution of Noun 189's submissions.

### Merchandise

Community members will contribute to design decisions influencing Nounish gear and apparel for our athletes that's also available for purchase by members at a discount.

![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/73ff2e413074eaa60c9f6e067f1ee63f713d9eb3_2_690x256.jpeg)

### Collaborations

Artist and athlete collaborations will be earmarked for inclusion in the Gnars protocol and on merchandise. The community will decide what's *gnartwork* and what isn't.

### Gnarketplace

[Gnarket.place](https://gnarket.place) is our dedicated marketplace running on ZORA's auction house contracts, various features for filtering and inspecting traits will continue rolling out as normal.

### Games

[Grinderz](https://gnars.fun) will continue operating as an addictive way to climb a global leaderboard and win ETH at regular intervals.

![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/187ec6b6a26a469ff64675c7ff0a663a77a25faa_2_690x431.jpeg)

[Gnarnia](https://gna.rs), our MMO will also continue development, eventually expanding to other extreme sports outside of skateboarding (à la California Games...[sneak peek here](https://twitter.com/gnars_dao/status/1511529856961740803)).

### Nouns Athletes

We are well positioned to (with Joe's help) rally behind an expanding pro team of extreme athletes with a propensity for diversity and inclusion.

![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/3b5caeccaec6b2727b455dadffb69b3e5bccff96_2_690x388.png)

Those who explore their creativity and self-expression are favoured over those who are mostly known for winning contests.

![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/6288f32a78c584e2c64ffc83fad0c5d7ef582d8f_2_690x151.png)

Joe's Travala account was funded with [this transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe01a13d23de9c47771caf38a1d5f0c9359c1c464e24d22056ef22cdeb7e01f3b) for the sponsorship proof of concept. Facilitating sponsorships is as simple as depositing ETH to platforms such as [Travala](https://www.travala.com/) and [Bitrefill](https://bitrefill.com/) that allow for USD credits. 

These can be used to purchase flights, accommodation and even gear from Amazon etc, as required.

## Shred the Nouns

Despite the original experiment for Nouns Athletes still being in progress, the current challenges facing Nouns DAO present an opportunity to scale sooner. 

Ideally, an experiment such as this one could evolve into a sub-DAO playbook, that encourages Nounish builders to be bold.

![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/407d76d9a2bf528a96d85963ef0afe616eaf4274.png)

The essence of this proposal is taking a risk on extending the permissionless collaboration model to the allocation of capital. 

If you’re operating a Nouns extension, you should be applying for Nouns DAO grants funding – you’re a startup, so define your mission and pursue it.

## Fund the Gnars

**Reminder:** an Extreme Sports DAO tasked with...

1. Managing a Nouns DAO funded and decentralised treasury
2. Sponsoring athletes with grants for travel and content creation
3. Making production, merch, event and protocol decisions

**Requesting 69 ETH** to establish a Gnars DAO fund, stewarding an expansion of Nouns Athletes with travel sponsorships for action sports professionals, across eight (or more) target disciplines.

**FISE World Series late May,** where Nouns Athlete, Joe Atkinson, will be competing for his 4th inline skating title, presents potential to sponsor (subject to change) a:

* BMX rider
* Climber
* Mountain bike rider
* Parkour free-runner
* Scooter rider
* Skateboarder
* Wakeboarder

**Approximate budget of...**

* Annual $25k USD per athlete (contest/filming travels) 
* Equating to $200k or the majority of 69 ETH grant 
* Approx $225k at current ETH price

**Finally, there is also the option to sponsor fewer athletes** at a higher amount, for example *five athletes at $40k each* (lots of demand for supporting winter sports).

Thank you everynoun for taking the time to peruse this proposal and if I have your support I look forward to receiving your vote.

Putting this proposal on-chain in collaboration with Miguel Faus

# [Calladita Film](https://www.calladitafilm.com/)

First European (and second ever) fiction movie funded with NFTs, based on an award-winning short film with an A-list cast attached.

[**2-minute Intro Video on Twitter**](https://twitter.com/miguelfaus/status/1500867988341280771?s=20&t=7jVlhyOdDeGSoR8Wg9BoDg)

[![Calladita](https://i.ibb.co/z4f3grt/calladita1.png)](https://www.calladitafilm.com/)


## About the Film
*The movie will be shot in Barcelona (Spain) in September, and is **expected to premiere in International Festivals in spring 2023**, and then in cinemas (there’s distribution agreements in place with Spanish and U.S. distributors) and finally in streaming platforms.*
*We want this historic web3 movie to have several easter eggs of NFT and Web3 Culture, and the Nouns embody decentralization and CC0 like no other project, so we would love to find ways to showcase Nouns in the film.*

*The entirety of the proceeds from the NFT collection will go towards the budget of the film: locations, equipment rentals, cast & crew, travel & accommodation, post-production…, and so I would like to propose that the DAO contributes to the budget of the film, and in exchange we contribute to “proliferating Nouns” by showing them in this pioneering web3 film.*
*We believe that “Calladita” has the potential of starting a movement towards the decentralization of cinema via web3, because film is still the most centralized and corporation-controlled art form around.*

## Nouns in Calladita
Nouns will be included in the movie as follows:
1.    A Character in the film will wear Nouns Glasses in at least 1 scene.
2.    There will be a chosen Noun put as decoration on the location of the film, which will appear in at least 1 scene. 
3.    Credits: either the Nouns glasses or one chosen Noun will appear in the Credits of the film, and NounsDAO will appear credited as an “Associate Producer” of the movie.

## Funding Request
The total budget of the film is 1.4M$, so we’re looking to raise that amount through our NFT collection. We would ask for a **contribution of 6.9 ETH** from Nouns DAO for this collaboration.

### SharkDAO is looking to create a multi-sig wallet w/ Big Shot Toyworks and requesting 50E from NounsDAO to fund... 

FUNctional Nounish Glasses by Bigshot Toyworks:
https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-funglasses-sage-2-tooling-molds/927

Google Doc link w/ pics (text below): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ESzii8-OVRPkqLGOvZQ0dxfwCvLJ7tt1Q_iakSI8fMU/edit?usp=sharing
 

## STAGE 2 (MANUFACTURING)

Prototype samples are ready. Now we need to start tooling and factory prep for production:

2A: Tooling 
Development and production of high quality precision steel molds for the mass manufacturing process.
 
Sample molds produced by Bigshot in similar materials

Injection molds- ABS and PC (Polycarbonate), plus packaging design/layout, packaging dies & blister tray molds: 
Cost estimate: $25-32K (10 ETH equivalent) 
Above includes: Paint molds, tampo molds for keychain and any QR codes. Any kind of debugging and pilot run to test viability and revisions. 

Notes on tooling: tooling is a one-time charge, unless we need to increase bulk production to meet demand and make X more molds etc. Molds will be stored for reuse as needed.




Deluxe gift box packaging, Satin finish with Spot UV, High gloss printing, Blister tray packaging packed in individual shippers for easy distribution. 5 ps per carton, and 4 cartons to master carton. Notes on package design: The package concept has space on it to showcase approximately 20+ nouns characters. We can chose the most Nounish or pleasing pieces that work in the layout (would love a list and images ASAP if community wants to weigh in)


2B: Production
Cost estimate $13-17 USD per unit packaged as a final product
SRP: $20-22 wholesale, $40-45 retail 

The goal of these is to distribute as many as possible so these can be allocated as giveaways to shows and events or sold at a wholesale price giving the event an opportunity to make money.

Sample first order breakdown:

5000 pcs Incl. 500 GOLD NOUNDER GIFTS:
3000 red 
1000 blue 
500 TBD (Pink ???)
500 BLACK 
500 CHROME GOLD -exclusive to NOUN holders and only available through our gated shop

IF Noun Holders want one of each  of any exclusives we need to consider additional orders

Best to make first order as large as possible to cover any events during the next 6 months to 1 year 

Important to consider the Nounish community needs for these Funglasses in the initial order so that there is enough stock on hand to satisfy any and all proposed promotional efforts.
 
2C: Logistics and shipping
 
Air shipping for samples and any show exclusives
Sea shipping for mass production
All items shipped to our 3PL warehouse in the USA for warehousing & fulfillment.

Unless otherwise specified, Bigshot will act as a custodian for the physical glasses products and continue to develop new colors and possible tie-ins with other brands.





2D: Maintaining stock & availability in USA

Bigshot will maintain a public-facing web shop with stock. We will make quantities of glasses available to Nouns at the discretion of the DAO for events and promotions and any other purpose. Will allocate specified quantities to Noun holders through our gated web store at no cost.

Should there be event planning for future activities where we would need to manufacture exclusive products in special colors or packaging, or larger quantities, we need about 4-6 months notice at least. Air shipping is always available to expedite delivery but that is much more expensive than slow sea shipping.

Need to create web content for any scans of QR codes or Box scans to launch interactive elements like 3D AR Nouns or animated 3D Nouns.
 
Nounish community benefit: each Noun holder or friend /family could claim 5 free sets of glasses + shipping and handling worldwide (for example). If there are 300 Noun holders, and each holder gets 5 free glasses, then we need to plan for US stock to be depleted by 1500 units right away.

The rest of the stock will be available in the shop at a $40 USD retail but allocated to the various events and promotions as needed at a wholesale of $20 each. 





2E: Sundries associated with creating and selling physical goods

We would need to purchase LIABILITY INSURANCE
Cost estimate: $6-8K per year (or ETH equivalent)

In all instances, when paying for physical goods projects in ETH, we need to address the volatility of ETH. We would need to convert all ETH payments into fiat immediately in order to pay vendors like factories, warehouse, logistics companies etc.

Suggestion to establish quarterly payment to maintain all of the parts moving.  Warehouse, logistics/production manager etc

2F: Global Community Engagement Strategies

Promoting Noun glasses & increasing visibility of the brand. Some of our ideas include:

Toy & pop culture conventions around the world (UK toycon/DCON, TTS, Wonder festival Design Fiesta, Shanghai toy show, beijing toy show etc)
NFT-related meetups & events
Sports events Pro and college level - Funglasses giveaways at stadiums
Promotional tie-ins e.g. Bud Light? 
Commercial use / brand use of the products Custom glasses frames with unique packaging similar to Bearbricks
Art shows and events like a space at ART Basel (wynwood walls or SCOPE) , a DesignerCon takeover, a booth at NYCC, etc
Active social media placements through targeted giveaways and event appearances documented on social media 
DCON TAKEOVER (NOUN-A-PALOOZA) with a 20x30 or larger booth experience with DJs, live art and activities  (papercraft, coloring books. DIY glasses projects etc) - featuring all of the current & upcoming Nounish projects sponsored by the DAO presented as a case study for what is possible with Nouns and more.
5000 sets of glasses insert into the VIP bags at Dcon
A NOUNTOWN in a metaverse, a place to hold events, art shows etc. DECENTRALLAND or?
We could use Funglasses in an onboarding package for new community members, both Nouners and newbs. - can have QR codes to easily disseminate info about the Nouns community and what is available to community members - answering the questions who, what and why?
Influencer mailers


Timing of New Production Projects:
Any Funglasses needs / events that the community decides upon that would overrun our available inventory in the USA warehouse would have to be communicated to us within a timeframe that allows us to quote on, produce and ship the required goods. Both air and sea shipping are extremely expensive these days, so a lot of advance planning is required for bigger production projects (ideally 4 months advance notice, can be cut to 3 months if we do air shipping).
Cost estimate: TBD

One way to avoid long production delays is to initially produce an overage of thousands of pairs of glasses in the main colors and store them in our USA warehouse so we have an abundance of stock to ship out as needed.

Warehousing extra units has a cost - our warehousing partner charges by square foot. So we would need to estimate monthly cost of keeping the inventory based on how many units we keep on hand and how long we intend to store them.
Cost estimate: TBD




Due to fluctuating ETH value and the fact that we need to immediately convert ETH into fiat to send to factory, we need to calculate each of the above payments right before it is due.

 
LETS GO!












SUMMARY OF COSTS:

OVERALL FUNGLASSES ESTIMATED PROJECT COSTS
(not including marketing / community engagement)

Tooling: 10 ETH *Note Small Grants is giving 5E to get this going now
Production @ 5K units: 26 ETH
Shipping / logistics estimate: 5 ETH
Warehousing for 1 year: 4 ETH
Liability insurance for 1 year: 3 ETH

TOTAL ESTIMATE: 48-55 ETH (approx 0.01 ETH per unit)

Expenses for a 2nd order would be lower per unit due to the elimination of the one time costs.
SIMPLE PAYMENT BREAKDOWN:

SharkDAO & Bigshot Multi-Sig -    0x6C3A3374f1250597431d4ead59C35FBadf132b40

#1 tooling payment due ASAP to begin - 10 ETH (project is ready to go - there is a 35-45 day process between initial payment to test shots stage)
#2 - 30 days later - production deposit payment 50% of whatever production ends up being
(There may be minimal fluctuations in costs due to the deluxe packaging) 
#3 - 45 days  later - final balance production due
#4 - 30 days later logistics - costs determined at time of payment due

Still trying to figure out the final cost/process etc on the small details as it is pretty involved and needs to be developed for this and future projects.

57,Bring luxury Noun sunglasses to market,"# Bring luxury Noun sunglasses to market

## Summary

A couple months ago small grants funded the prototyping of a luxury sunglass initiative by salvinoarmati: https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grant-request-create-luxury-noun-sunglasses-irl/658. This proposal is to fund the initial run and launch of the physical and NFT components of this project. More details here: https://ivory-pine-ebc.notion.site/NounsDAO-Proposal-29a658f763f74f958f7c6bd916533dbb.

## Upcoming plan

We’re planning to launch these as an NFT collection of limited-edition glasses. Each NFT is *consumable* in the sense that it can be used *once* to redeem a physical pair. Once the NFT is used, a boolean value is flipped to indicate consumed status and the underlying tokenURI is permanently changed. A physical pair of sunglasses is then sent to you.

**~7.2% of supply reserved for NounsDAO Treasury**

The total supply of the collection will be 6969 units. This project would not have been possible without the NounsDAO and the treasury.  As a thank you, we’ve decided to allocate ~7.2% of the supply to the treasury (500 units). We hope to make other such contributions as a thank you to the DAO in the future. 

**Custom Edition Glasses Just For Noun holders**

We’re also making a custom “special edition” pair *exclusively* for noun owners. The design of these glasses will be based off of the under-appreciated and rare “disco” glasses featured on some nouns. *There will only 500 of these glasses ever made, and will be available to the first 500 nouns during mint. This means, future nouns (up to #500) will also be able to receive the glasses.*

## *High-level todos that still remain*

- **Create Smart Contract, Website, Minting, and Redeeming Experience.**
    - Have had a preliminary call with @blequity at Zora and will be using Zora’s smart contract system to launch this NFT.
    - Both Signora Armati and I are software engineers so will be able to build most of this —but we may hire 1 or 2 engineers to accelerate the timeline.
- **Finalize a storage/distribution facility for shipping the sunglasses.**
    - We’ll need to organize a distribution facility which will serve a few functions:
        - Long-term storage of glasses (for those that are unredeemed or redeemed later)
        - We have items coming from multiple manufacturers (Sunglasses, Nouns Box, Carrying case, polishing cloth, thank you cards) — and will need an area to assemble and ship out all boxes.
- **Promotional Video / Ad**
    - We want to create a fun promo (IRL) video that showcases the glasses + nouns brand. We’ve had a preliminary call with [@jasonmorena_](https://twitter.com/jasonmorena_) (who was previously the filmmaker for Gary Vee) who has expressed interest in creating an ad for us.
- **Finalize glass design and create units at scale.** 

### **Funds Requested**

- 115Ξ for creating the smart contract, website, promotional/marketing material (this will be most of the remaining work), distribution facility, and to start manufacturing.
- 1 Noun of the DAO's choice upon successful delivery of the first physical pair of glasses.

59,Gamify fundraising for Ukraine by donating 51 ETH through the Rescue Toadz project,"# Gamify fundraising for Ukraine by donating 51 ETH through the Rescue Toadz project


## Summary
The goal is to donate 51 ETH for humanitarian aid to Ukraine and increase the popularity of the Rescue Toadz (https://rescuetoadz.xyz/) charity project so that more people start donating as well.

## Methodology
Rescue Toadz is a charity project that gamifies the fundraising process. It is an NFT collection of 18 toadz with 100% of the funds being donated to Ukraine via Unchain Ukraine. A special bidding mechanic encourages people to donate more.

The gamified aspect is that you can not only mint toadz, but also transfer someone else’s toad in your wallet by matching or increasing their last donation. The toad then drops its noun glasses as POAP in the wallet of the original holder.

This mechanism is coded directly in the smart contract and a toad owner cannot prevent the toad from hopping into another wallet. This encourages people to donate more - if they want to keep their toad they need to increase the price of the donation or acquire back the toad if somebody donated more.

100% of the funds are immediately sent from the Rescue Toadz smart contract to Unchain Ukraine. It is a pure charity project - the project devs make no money from it.

## Why not donate directly to Unchain?
The idea is not only for Nouns DAO to donate, but also to encourage other people to donate as well. For example, NounsDAO will donate for already minted toadz and “steal” them from the previous owners. Some of them will then donate again to get their toad back.

The goal of the proposal is to donate 0.2 ETH for 5 toadz that are already minted and “steal” them from the previous owners and also raise the prices for two other toadz to 10 ETH and 40 ETH respectively.

## Conclusion
Donating 51 ETH through the Rescue Toadz project has the following benefits:

Funds raised by NounsDAO to help Ukrainian people recover from the war
Raised popularity of the Rescue Toadz charity project, so more people start donating

61,Residency for cdt.eth,"# Residency for cdt.eth

Hey all, my name is Christian. Through this proposal I will be able to dedicate myself full-time to Nouns as opposed to when I can fit it in after my day job & other responsibilities.

**What I’ve worked on for Nouns**
- Currently building Nouns Center, a [community site](https://nouns.center/) for Nouns projects & tools
- Co-developed Lost Nouns, an [extension](https://lostnouns.wtf/) project with unused assets
- Host & produce Noun O’ Talk, a [podcast](https://pod.link/1615472873) interviewing Noun owners & builders
- Worked on [Nouns proposal #9](https://nounspoap.com/) for creating POAPs for daily auctions
- Created [SharkDAO’s](https://sharks.wtf/) (Nouns sub-dao) website
- Founding [Nouncil](https://nouncil.wtf/gov) member

![final](https://i.imgur.com/fNOPFAh.jpg)
 
**What I will do during my residency**

**1. Nouns Center -** I have incredibly high hopes for this project and a big feature list that is ever-growing. Capturing the entirety of our community’s data in one place is no small feat but has already proven to be useful. Seeing it being linked to answer questions is gratifying. I want every piece of Nouns info to be a link away and I want to empower devs and artists to build off Nouns. I will continue to hold “office hours” and be as transparent as possible with my progress.

**2. Noun O’ Talk -** A passion project in the truest sense. We’ve had 27 guests on over 9 episodes from extension builders to board members to DAO members and even Bud Light. I aim to keep these conversations interesting and informative, and I have a ton of other folks lined up and would love to keep working on this. I’d like to add a theme song and edit the audio while continually hosting these live on a weekly basis and then publishing to all podcast platforms.

**3. Prop House -** I plan on coming aboard and helping out with the frontend, developing v2, and solidifying it’s place as a great tool in our ecosystem.

**Funds requested**

$175K* paid over 6 months in USDC which equates to roughly 8.5E/month by todays valuation.

*the equivalent of $190k `(to absorb potential volatility in ETH from time period between submission and execution)` would  would be sent to a multisg managed by trusted members of the community (9999, Seneca, and Toastee), they would then convert $175k worth of ETH to USDC, set up the stream and then send back the remaining ETH to the DAO.

62,Prop House Continuation,"# Prop House Continuation

**tl;dr:**
Prop House has shown promise as an alternative funding mechanism for the DAO via it’s web app and ETH<>Proposal auction format. I’m requesting 214 ETH (120 funding props / 94 opex) to continue to explore the Prop House model as a way to scale capital deployment over the next 4 months. 

### What has  happened since [Prop 23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23):
- Built [prop.house](https://prop.house) 
- Funded 9 proposals for a total of 15 ETH
- Received 69 proposals over two funding rounds (third round kicked off 4/13)
- Opened dialogue with extension communities to onboard into Prop House, holding conversations with leaders and community members to understand their footing.
- Gained 1,000+ followers on the Prop House twitter account
- [Expense report](https://airtable.com/shr5UPKk4jyhveIDd)

### Reflections:

**Quality proposals**
The two core hypotheses with initial testing were that 1) there would be a meaningful volume of proposals given the ETH<>Proposal auction format and 2) some subset of proposals would be high quality. With 69 proposals and a double digit % of those being highly desirable, I feel confident that we should continue to pursue scale via the prop house model.

**Communities are eager to participate**
With a total of 48 proposals and 520 votes casted by 77 non-nouners for Round 1, it’s clear that members of the broader community, both individually and as part of extension communities, are eager to participate. It’s behavior like this that points to how NFT communities can grow beyond their ownership-constrained communities (particularly true for Nouns).

**DAO-only voting won't scale**
Given the volume of proposals received in Funding Round 1, it's clear that a Prop House where only Nouners are voting won't enable us to scale to 1000s of proposals. i.e. It's irrational to expect Nouners to be reading through 50 proposals every week. If we are to hit scale, decision making needs to be gradually decentralized. 

### Beyond funding - a new way to interact:
Framing the ERC721 standard as the social graph, Prop House may be looked at as a “permissionless ETH power source that communities gather around” (h/t joel).

Analogous to reddit, we now have crypto-native subreddits but are missing the key ingredient that makes crypto so special - the ability to transact, transform and create value. 

**With this proposal**, Prop House looks to do two things:
1) Focus development on the Nouns Prop House as the main node in the network:
    - Nail down UX 
    - Experiment with different funding amounts, longer and shorter rounds 
3) Explore the ways in which the DAO can further its reach via independent Prop Houses (e.g. prop.house/**japan**, /**extensions**, /**budlight**)
    - Enable these communities to become self-curating Prop Houses where their members both submit and vote on their own proposals.

### Team:
- seneca (all hats)
- devcarrot (backend)
- toastee (design)
- cdt (frontend)
- jckbutcher (memes)

### Budget:

We are requesting working + funding capital for **4 months** of operations. 

- Funding props, 120 ETH:
    - 80 ETH for Nouns Prop House
    - 40 ETH for 1-3 Nouns extensions Prop Houses (e.g. japan, nounpunks, budlight)
- Operational, 94 ETH:
    - 23.5 ETH per month:
        - 10 ETH seneca 
        - 3.5 ETH devcarrot
        - 3.5 ETH toastee
        - 3.5 ETH jckbutcher
        - 3 ETH for other potential misc expenses 

**Considerations**
- Funding schedule is meant to be flexible so that we can both experiment (diff funding amounts) and slowly ramp up (i.e. start with 1 extension prop house)
- Funding amounts and corresponding communities will be decided internally by the Prop House team. Some of the heuristics we are using to select communities:
    - Enough activity to merit competition between proposals
    - Willingness to onboard from leadership
    - Alignment with nounish culture and proliferation
- The ideal and final version of Prop House would allow for all decisions with regards to funds leaving the DAO to be decided upon by Nouners via vote. 

**Multi-sig**
The [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5BcD6f3B0a5519D448FBDf33204091bbE097C992) is currently 2/3 where the signers are seneca, devcarrot and toastee. It still holds ~20 ETH from [prop 23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23). With the passing of this proposal, we will be adding 2 more signers (cdt and jckbutcher). The addresses are as follows:
- safe: 0x5BcD6f3B0a5519D448FBDf33204091bbE097C992

- devcarrot: 0xB1C41C71d36cedEa7DdCd5f8D5c5C32BA8f3CBFc
- toastee: 0x5F99FC2d2A98e046t9689d3117e0F96bb5c640d88
- cdt: 0xD19BF5F0B785c6f1F6228C72A8A31C9f383a49c4
- jckbutcher: 0xD1295FcBAf56BF1a6DFF3e1DF7e437f987f6feCa


### Closing thoughts
Prop 23 enabled the first experiment of the Prop House model. Given the results, it seems to me that the answer to ""is there something here?"" was a resounding yes. Moving forward, I hope to continue to build with the same framing: an exploration to see what the model can amount to.

For this next phase, there are a few key questions that I'd like to have more definitive answers to, chief among them: 
- Is the volume of quality proposals meaningful?
- Will funding align extension/external communities to proliferate Nouns? 
- Is the Prop House model a viable approach to pursue 100x growth? 

The goal of this proposal is to answer these questions by continuing to develop the UX while taking our first steps towards independent Prop Houses.

If this second phase succceeds, I intend to eventually  develop Prop House into an trustless on-chain solution. As stated in [Prop 23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23):
> Conceptually, the contracts could be the seed to a crypto native Y Combinator model. Where as before you had partners, now you have DAO members. Instead of summer and winter batches, you have weekly or monthly cadences. And instead of demographic restrictions for applicants, you have anyone with an Ethereum wallet. It might be the case that breaking thresholds in the categories mentioned above transforms the model to something completely different.

From lessons learned in the first phase, I'd reframe it by saying that utilizing only DAO members won't scale. Instead, plugging into open and available social graphs (ERC721) is the way.",EXECUTED,14624201,14643911,0,27,,0,0,0,279,71,0,0,['214000000000000000000'],['0x5bcd6f3b0a5519d448fbdf33204091bbe097c992'],[''],14611061,1650310711,0xb70e3b648344a0ad9086f68c7325d07bc7750a46da94e79c28b0a38f608390cb,['0x'],0x6f9e3976fa3b5b22761fe5d635e1f0d9d9aeb85d
63,Pilot Collectivized Nounish Allocation,"# Pilot Collectivized Nounish Allocation 

 **Purpose**
 
 Equip Builders to Steward DAO Resources
 
 **Ask**
 
100 Ξ

**Covenant (tl;dr)**

Any Noun (""Nouner"") or member of the Nouns Discord server and given the ""Nouncillor"" role (http://discord.gg/nouns) will be eligible to co-administer distribution of Ask in an experimental effort to democratize funding by and of protocol (NounsDAO) contributors. The objective for this round will be to empower the collective of active Nouns builders to convey Ξ in a manner that attempts to effect sustained outsize benefit to Nounish Culture.

**Procedure** 
1. Funds custodied in the Nouncil (nouncil.eth) multisig, which signers and their constituents (Nouncillors) have agreed to defend according to the above mandate. 
2. Open call will be held in the Nouns Discord Server for Nouners/Nouncillors wanting to co-administer. 
3. Administrators will refine a process for adding candidates who are interested in participating, biasing for inclusivity where possible, while considering how the process may be sustainably implemented at protocol level in future.
4. If nominated, addition of non-voting addresses (NounsDAO/SubDAO Treasuries, Public Goods etc) as potential beneficiaries may be considered.   
5. Approved contributors will be allowlisted / encouraged to participate in an off-chain weighted voting process (via an application such as https://snapshot.org/ or https://coordinape.com/) to determine the final distribution coefficients.
7. Any funds which the administrators conclude they are unable to disburse constructively (in accordance with Covenant) by 07/01/22 will be returned to DAO.
8. The custodian of the proposing Noun (*wag#5265*) will recuse themselves from the round. 
9. Some additional context is currently available at: https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-pilot-coordinape-round-s-to-implement-retroactive-impact-rewards/929/5

**Possible Failure Conditions**  
1. Disagreements arise as to proper execution of Covenant, where clear consensus (measured as a simple majority vote) among Administrators cannot be reached.
2. Number of nominated contributors is too low or too high to be deemed a useful representation of active Nouns builders.
3. Unforeseen technical constraints make executing the weighted vote or disbursement impractical. 

**Possible Success Conditions**

64,Marketing Studio for Nouns-funded Projects,"# Marketing Studio for Nouns-funded Projects

**TL;DR**

- Fund a studio to create short videos telling the world about the projects that Nouns fund.
- Offer builders to tap into a marketing studio with Noun-specific expertise, free of charge.
- We will work with builders to tell their project’s story in the most digestible and compelling way.
- We will edit these videos to fit the formats of the top social media platforms.
- These videos will be shared on new social media accounts dedicated to telling the stories of Nouns-funded projects. The goal of these videos will be to reach new audiences to amplify the reach of the projects we have funded.
- Create a free resource of CC0 Nouns-proposal-related footage and assets.

**The Problem**

- Prop builders don’t necessarily have the skills/resources/time to execute a marketing campaign for their projects.
- Wonderful projects with really great output are not being amplified and we are missing out on a lot of noun proliferation potential.
- It’s difficult to explain what Nouns are to the world.

**The Solution**

- We propose to build a team dedicated to market the projects that Nouns fund.
- We will offer the most promising projects the option to work with us closely to produce a video that markets their project.
- We will do whatever is necessary to make the videos as compelling and impactful as possible, like:
    - Develop a compelling story about the project.
    - Send a film crew to the builders' studio for an interview and B-roll footage.
    - Edit the videos in different formats for different social media platforms to maximize virality.
    - Publish the videos on social media accounts - on all major social media outlets: twitter, facebook, instagram, tiktok, and youtube.
    - Manage interaction with social media followers.

**Why is this awesome?**

- **Tell the Nouns story via the projects we fund**
    - The best way to tell the story of Nouns is via its funded projects. The projects and builders that the treasury funds are what is nounish. The substance of the proposals are the most compelling and accessible narratives of Nouns DAO. These stories will also attract more builders to submit proposals to the protocol.
- **Let the builders focus on building**
    - Builders don’t have to be marketing experts.
    - We want to enable builders to focus on delivering their projects in the best way - and let us produce the video marketing assets they need.
    - We hope that potential builders who see these videos will get inspired to create quality proposals themselves, knowing that this support and exposure will be there.
- **Use the treasury to its fullest potential**
    - An awesome Nouns-funded project that not many know about is a waste of our treasury.
    - We will make sure to amplify the work that’s being done by our prop builders and reach a wide audience.
- **CC0 Nouns Video Stock**
    - Similar to public domain stock videos, all footage that we will gather in the process of producing these videos will be CC0 and available online
        - Initially we will share a Google Drive or Dropbox with these files. We will also experiment with posting the footage in CC0 stock video websites like [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).
        - In the future, if there’s demand, we may want to build a dedicated website to enable easy access to the footage.
    - This will enable the composability of our storytelling by giving access to right-free footage to, for example:
        - Projects like the [Rose Parade documentary](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-go-to-the-rose-parade-a-documentary-by-the-makers-of-robot-chicken/1046) will be able to use our raw footage as part of their documentary, permissionlessly.
        - YouTubers who produce an explainer video about Nouns.
        - News outlets who are reporting about Nouns.
        - All future documentaries about the protocol.
    - This will enable more “memetic stimulus”: more visual content from our projects can result in more nounish memes!

**Scope of The Pilot**

We want to start with a small pilot of 4 published videos, delivered within the next few months. These videos will be 30-90 seconds, bite sized content for easy consumption and maximum shareability. They will focus on summarizing a single project/proposal – with a little context about nouns as well.

In this pilot we want to experiment and learn as much as possible (e.g. How to work best with builders? What content type and format gets the most engagement? How do we manage remote film crews?).  Once we successfully deliver on the pilot and we have learned a ton, we will probably submit another proposal to produce more videos.

- Work with builders to create videos telling the stories of 4 projects:
    - Confirmed:
        - Coloring Books by Messhup
    - Other projects we would love to work with but haven’t fully confirmed yet:
        - Nouns Psychogeography Sculpture with Dustin Yellin

# Mad Realities x Nouns DAO

### **What is it?**

Mad Realities is building audience-owned TV, starting with an interactive reality TV network where the audience votes on cast, shows, and more via holding an NFT. Think TV, but owned by and voted by the community. 

**The finale taking place on May 1st at Webster Hall** is for our first show Proof of Love, a community funded, created, participated, and decided dating show powered by NFTs. Season 0 kicked off March 13th and we've already had:

- 1,500+ people on the internet co-creating the show with us
- 172 ETH worth of Membership Pass NFTs minted which funded all the show production to begin with
- 4 IRL live shows hosted at NFT art gallery [Bright Moments](https://www.brightmoments.io/) with 300+ audience members (max capacity of the venue)
- Notable guests judges like [Victoria Paris](https://www.tiktok.com/@victoriaparis?lang=en), [Matt Medved](https://twitter.com/mattmedved), [Antoni Bumba](https://www.tiktok.com/@antonibumba?lang=en), [Elsie Hewitt](https://instagram.com/elsie), [Meltem Demirors](https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem), [Nolita Dirtbag](https://www.instagram.com/nolitadirtbag/?hl=en), [Aubrey Strobel](https://twitter.com/aubreystrobel), [Alex Zhang](https://twitter.com/alexzhang__), and more.

This proposal is for NounsDAO to put **50 ETH** towards the festivities alongside Zora (also contributing 50 ETH) for a chance to be 800+ 20-somethings in NYC’s first touchpoint with web3 and the endless possibilities of crypto in culture. It’s also going to be really fucking fun.

### How would it work?

**Date: Sunday, May 1st**

**Venue: Webster Hall**

**IRL Audience: 800-1000 NYC based 20-somethings (50% female)**

**URL Audience: NFT holders of the episodes, Twitter** 

**Run of show:** In our season finale, 4 winning couples from past episodes will compete in a showdown to prove their love to the audience, where the audience is the final decider of which couple wins the jackpot prize (4.20 ETH). Anyone in the world will be able to text our hotline to vote – similar to American Idol days — and by doing so will be able to mint one of our condom NFTs as well — not so similar.

- 6:30pm ET - Doors Open
- 7pm ET - Begin airing recap episodes from Season Zero
- 8pm ET - Final Episode Airs on Youtube and live at Webster Hall
- 8:30pm ET - One hour long live streamed After Show (with 2-3 musical performances)
- 9:30pm ET - Winner of finale episode is chosen live
- 10:30pm ET - Invite only after party at The Jane (you are invited to join us!)

### **Why?**

The Mad Realities team has mad respect for NounsDAO as one of the pioneers of CC0 as a viable model to spread a decentralized brand & meme.

We ourselves are making that leap, and the night will mark history as Mad Realities enters Proof of Love into Creative Commons (CC0) and allows anyone to mint full episodes of the show and most meme-worthy clips, and own a piece of reality TV.

It will be a bold experiment in putting a whole TV show in Creative Commons — along with the infinite stories that we expect our community to tell far into the future. We picture anyone in the world creating their own Proof of Love spinoff in the future — including experimenting with new formats, mediums (TikTok vs. Youtube vs. Live Stream vs. Audio vs. Snapchat, and more), themes, locations, and casts.

### **Funds Requested**

This proposal requests from the DAO:

- 50 ETH to go towards the production of the festivities

Funds would be used towards live after show production, venue costs, talent booking, co-branded merchandise, marketing expenses, and a portion of the bar tab at our invite only after party at the Jane Hotel (open to NounsDAO members shall the proposal be approved 👀).

### What does NounsDAO get out of it?

Help Mad Realities herald a new era in Hollywood. In exchange, Nouns gets...

1.

“Nouncillor” is a volunteer position, whose main role is discussing and voting on Nouns DAO proposals. We are requesting a reasonable budget to incentivize Nouncillors to put in additional work beyond that scope.

“Operating cost” funds would be earmarked for Nouncil administrative items such as:

 - Creating and operating Gnosis Safe
 - Social media management
 - Meeting notes
 - Content development
 - Website development
 - General organization
 - Nouncil proposal development & on-chain submission

Operating Costs will be distributed via a collaborative Coordinape round and all Nouncillors will get an equal voice. External contributors and Nouners who helped set up Nouncil up will be invited to join the circle as potential recipients. Q1 Coordinape will be administered immediately. We will prepare a report of how the operating costs were distributed and host it on the Nouncil website publicly.

Program specific operating costs will be distributed in separate Coordinape rounds with the teams that worked on them.

Currently Nouns DAO proposal discussion on Discord and Discourse is encouraged, but still considered a volunteer activity. In the future we would like to think through and develop intuitive programs to incentivize Prop discussion.

**3. Nouncil Community Grant Pilot - 32 ETH**
__________________

1 ETH grants available to each eligible Nouncillor, to be spent in collaboration with the communities / projects they represent with the goal of proliferating Nouns by leveraging their networks.

Ideally, the grant will be sent directly to project / community wallets. The grant is permissionless, any eligible Nouncillor will receive it if they apply. It must be spent proliferating Nouns in the most effective way possible. Nouncillors may choose to delegate their grant to another Nouncillor. Funds that are unable to be spent effectively within the period will be sent back to Nouns DAO.

Nouncil will establish basic guidelines and rules on how these grants can be spent, but will leave a lot open to imagination. Projects should be highly aligned with Nouns DAO and celebrate both Nouns and Nounish culture. Nouncillors who accept the grant and misspend it will not be eligible for future Community Grants and may face expulsion from Nouncil.

Rule #1: funds from this grant cannot be used to buy NFTs or cryptocurrency.

At the end of every grant period we will host a Nouncil Community Grant wrap-up where recipients will be responsible for demonstrating what they were able to achieve. We intend for this wrap-up to be entertaining, and will only apply for future funding if Nouns DAO is thoroughly impressed.

For the Pilot all Nouncillors as of 4/20/22 (30 in total) will be eligible. In the future eligibility will be defined as: 2 months of Nouncil membership with a proposal vote participation rate of 69% or greater.

The Pilot grant period will be 3 months from receipt of funds. After the pilot the intention is to have quarterly grant periods.

**Goal**
Proliferate Nouns through esports initiatives, starting with the signing of a professional Dota 2 roster.

**Description**
Dota2 is a multi-decade-old esport that is currently being developed by Valve Software. They host the single largest prize pool tournament in esports, The International. The latest purse for this annual tournament was around $40 million USD. To qualify for The International, you participate in the Dota Professional Circuit (DPC) 2 league which takes place throughout the year. This is mostly an online, regional format, but each season culminates in an international LAN called a Major.

One of the first initiatives of our esports pod will be to sign “4 Zoomers” 3, a Division 1 North American DPC team.

**Budget: 35 ETH**

The majority of this budget will be used to compensate the roster of five players, their manager and coach for the upcoming DPC season. The team has agreed to sign from the day the proposal is voted-in until the end of the third DPC season, July 17.

We will be working with former player and caster Brax to to act as an ambassador and liaison within the Dota community. He will be hosting and casting at least two different Nouns branded Dota tournaments.

Some of the players stream individually via Twitch. We will create assets for their on-stream overlay.

**Administrative Multisig**
Brennen
Sasquatch
Maty
Goldy
Wag

**Deliverables**
Tournament stream viewership - Their most recent series from April 16th has 283,352 views on the VOD via Twitch. Live tournament broadcasts regularly have tens of thousands of concurrent viewers

1. Individual stream viewership - Some of the players on the roster regularly stream on their own while practicing (hundreds or thousands of concurrent viewers)

2. In game branding - Dota allows for DPC teams to have in-game branding through assets placed inside of the game’s landscape. Nouns branding will be visible in game as the team competes.

3. Name branding - The team will rebrand from 4 Zoomers to **Nouns Dota**.

4. Player name branding - Player names will include a Nounish sponsor tag. e.g.
**Gunnar.⌐◨-◨**

I am happy to report the team has offered us “Right of First Offer” for the upcoming Major and The International.

The road to TI for the team is as follows:

Achieving a top 2 placement in DPC North America (June 6 - July 17) qualifies them for the Major LAN in Arlington Texas (Aug 4 - 14th)
Performing well at the Major qualifies them for The International.(date TBD)

**Future**
If this pilot is deemed successful by Nouns, potential next steps include signing this Dota roster for an extended term, signing other gaming teams or esports athletes, and fleshing out an esports-focused subDAO.",EXECUTED,14663020,14682730,0,28,,0,0,0,286,67,0,1,['35000000000000000000'],['0xa46036c5554ae85599715422c71f8691d7c5d2e7'],[''],14649880,1650836301,0x6abdde2e3585df151f56225c527d0d26ac00e0abf1abce7825de159fce724934,['0x'],0xf8a065f287d91d77cd626af38ffa220d9b552a2b

# tl;dr
[MUC.xyz](https;//muc.xyz) is a two-day NFT event, which is scheduled for 27th & 28th of May 2022 in Munich, Germany.
Goal of the event is to offer a platform to a broader audience to empower, educate and onboard the interested public onto the NFT space.
We would ask for a nouns grant of **15 ETH** to have nouns sponsor the event and nounify it.
![image|
100%](https://i.imgur.com/H8VJZH0.jpeg)

# event in detail
The event will be hosted in Munich but will collaborate with a hackathon in Nuremberg. This way we ensure an inter-regional promotion of NFTs in the two biggest Cities of Bavaria (total population of ~2M people)

**The first day** introduces the underlying technologies of NFTs such as blockchain and smart contracts through panels and talks. Different areas of application of NFTs and their economic significance will be presented using successful examples from the gaming, fashion and art sectors. A panel discussion will be held to critically examine the technology and its benefits and to take a visionary look into the future of NFTs. On this day, the audience will be introduced to the world of NFTs and informed about the basics and possible areas of application.

**The second day** will be a deep dive into current topics and trends in Web3 and the world of NFTs. Representatives from Web3 projects and companies will present their NFT journey, current strategies and experiences. Trends, technological developments, as well as tax and regulatory aspects will be covered. The crypto and NFT communities and all interested parties are invited to exchange ideas in an interdisciplinary manner on this day.

The event is planned to attract ~400 people in-person and around the same amount to stream online over the course of 2 days.

[niftynaut](https://twitter.com/niftynaut): noun172, building [swap.kiwi](https://swap.kiwi) to help others swap their NFTs the safe way with each other.

# how will the event proliferate nouns?
In general, as the event has an educational approach, we hope also to spread the word about cc0 and convince more builders to think about what kind of license they want to use for their future NFT projects. Moreover, Nouns are not yet proliferating in Europe and sponsoring the conference will help get more attention to the protocol outside of North America.

+ We will let nouns nounify the event completely. Nouns will be THE sponsor who has their logo everywhere where the muc.xyz logo is.
+ We will have posters around the city to draw attention to the event.
+ We will nounify our website accordingly.
+ We will add nouns logo on all of our merchandise which is free for all attendees.
+ We will nounify the venue accordingly (roll-ups, photo wall).
+ We will mention nouns in our press release.
+ We will add a cc0 talk/panel to our event schedule
+ We organise some side NFT exhibitions - here we have the possibility to display nouns and their story. 
+ With representatives from the city and the state of Bavaria, chances are high that there will be photos circulating in the regional and national newspapers.

# event location and schedule
we are hosting the event at the [Haus der Kunst](https://hausderkunst.de/en/) (House of Art) which is a non-collecting modern and contemporary art museum in Munich, Germany.
![image|
100%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Haus_der_Kunst_-_Munich_-_2013.jpg)
Photographer: Avda / avda-foto.de

Date of the event is the 27th & 28th of May 2022.

The NFT event will help to educate the interested public about NFTs. We are sure this event will draw attention to NFTs and blockchain because it is touching the Zeitgeist and there are not many other events to educate the public about this technology in Germany, and so far none in Munich.

**There is still a great need for education and information in Germany.**  **There are a few events, but they differ in their objectives and focus.** 
**So far there are not many events to compare it even with.**

Right now it is a right and important time for our muc.xyz, precisely because there are so many different approaches, ideas, areas of application etc… **Our approach also stands out above all because of the first day, which focuses on critical observation and informing the broader public.**  On top of it, Bavaria has developed its own blockchain strategy. The added value of this technology for society, the economy and even for the administration is seen.

Munich is a hotspot for art! The art scene is alive and well. There are many collectors and art enthusiasts here. There is a lot of “old” culture and a lot of tradition. Our event fits right in as there is a vacuum currently we hope to fill.
We are also partnering with [Hackbay](https://www.hackbay.de) which organised many hackathons (200+ participants) and now organises its first web3 hackathon (Sponsors: Adidas, Siemens) in Nuremberg (population of ~800k).

Some more info about Munich:
* 3rd largest city in Germany, 11th largest City in the EU with a population of 1.6M
* The city is a global centre of art, science, technology, finance and its economy is based (besides cars) on high tech, creative industries, as well as IT.
* With large universities it attracts a lot of young people with whom it would be great to connect and educate about web3 and NFTs.

Let's create CC0 Story Bibles that can be the foundation for future stories and inspire creatives to create their own stories, animations and Nouns content.

When Blockbuster DAO recently proposed creating a Story Bible for Nouns there was hesitancy to fund the project for fear of establishing Canon. 

Through a series of conversations with various Nouners there seems to be concensus that rather than fund only BBDAO we want to fund multiple groups to create great CC0 Story Bibles for anyone in the community build off of, fork, animate, draw, etc.

I've spoken with BBDAO, Sam Ellis, StudioDAO & Greidiens who have all been following Nouns from the beginning, have great accomplishments and want to pursue this idea.

We will begin the process of creating Nounish characters, story explorations and series ideas that can lead to more and more diverse worlds built around Nouns. 

We propose to create a Multi-Sig and start by funding 6 CC0 Story Bibles at ~20E each (120E total) all by accomplished writers. This seems to be a bit above industry standard but takes into consideration the CC0 requirement for this experiment.*

Deliverables: Based on this thread we expect each Bible to include a general world/universe outline, 15-20 Characters w/ illustrations and character descriptions, 10+ story/episode ideas. We expect these to be illustrated and 20+ pages each.

The multi-sig would pay the writers on a schedule of 30% Up Front, 20% Upon Rough Draft, 50% Upon Completion. For this first round we will be focused on writer/creator teams that have high level credits and a history of delivering professional works on time.

Story Foundation & Development Lead 
Jawshua Fisher
I’ve been actively working with the teams, Nouners and Nouncil members on creating this proposal. I want to continue advising and consulting teams and basically providing an oversight over the whole project.

My goals for this project:
- project oversights - payments, deliverables, DAO updates
- advising and consulting the creative teams
- active outreach to writers, animators and producers for consideration
- phase 2 planning - reaching out to additional teams for production, illustration, animation, etc as well as exploring alternate ideas to create Story Foundations.

I anticipate this project drives a lot interest and this comp will cover other activities that arise such as general Noun advice (I get a lot of questions and offer support for folks looking to get into Nouns or make proposals) and overall Noun Creative support/activity. For this I am proposing a compensation of 6ETH/month for trial period of 3 months.

As a creative manager by trade I have experience helping creatives deliver while holding them to high standards and helping with ideas. I've also been here paying close attention since Noun 3 and feel I have a good foundation for many of the fun moments and underlying themes that have been embraced. Finally, I'm a multi-sig signer at SharkDAO and am active in the community. 

Legal & Set Up Fees 
I don't have a legal quote but think we could create a simple agreement with writers with a great lawyer for 10E or less, the high cost is due to uncertainty about DAO, CC0, etc. We will send back any unused funds. Will also use this fund for reimbursing the set up of the multi-sig.

Total Funding - 148E 
Creative Teams - 120E
DAO Oversight - 18E 
Legal Fees - 10E

[Discourse Proposal](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/non-fungible-aotearoa-documentary-about-the-artist-behind-noun-cats/1109)

**tl;dr**

An 8 minutes documentary on Dean Harvey, the artist behind Noun Cats extension. The focus of the film is to show how NFTs and Nouns are transforming people’s lives in NZ and in the world. We are aiming at international film/documentary festivals. The goal is to inspire more artists to join Nouns DAO.

**WHAT?**
A short documentary (between 8 and 10 minutes) on Dean Harvey, the artist behind Noun Cats extension.

**WHY?**
The focus of the documentary is to show how NFTs and Nouns are empowering emerging artists and really transforming people’s lives in NZ and in the world.

We learn about the Dean’s journey from web2 to web3 and hopefully inspire others to join the web3 movement and Nouns DAO.

We plan to release the film at international film festivals and therefore expose their audiences to the Nouniverse.

**VALUE PROPOSITION**
Nouns Dao to sign “Executive Producer” in a documentary aimed at international film festivals. Opening credit “NOUNS DAO presents” at the start of the film. All the raw footage, music and artwork to be added to the Marketing Studio free resource of CC0 assets.

**FUTURE / NEXT STEPS**
As we researched the web3 space here in New Zealand for an ongoing feature-length documentary, we found a group of very talented artists connected through NFTs and their own DAO. The Wenbreakfast DAO.

So, our next plan is to start a series of spin-offs for a streaming platform. One episode per artist in the Wenbreakfast DAO.

We hope the artists will wish to join Nouns DAO after watching Dean’s film and going through the experience of being the next talent portrayed in our documentary series.

**MORE ABOUT DEAN**
Among other things, he is hosting pixel arts lessons on twitch for the Noun Cats community.

A firm believer in the power of web3, not only he is working full-time on his project with backseats, but he is also building yet another extension, Early Birbs, with his Discord community.

During the live sessions, the PFP traits are created with the audience, in real-time.

Dean is paying it forward by teaching others the art and technique that transformed his life.

The proposal is for Nouns DAO to fund Stage 1 of 2 of NOUNish Friends, a 10,000 run of modular Nounish collectibles designed, created, and distributed by Bigshot Toys. Klim and team have been working on this for months (along with other Nounish projects, like [Propsal 56 for Fun Noggles](https://nouns.wtf/vote/56))  and they not only have extensive expertise in creating collectibles like this but also have a specific vision for their NOUNish Friends line beyond just making them but getting them distributed in high signal locations and in front of forward thinking people.

**What is the NOUNish friends project?**

A modular collectible physical toy series based on Nouns and created by an award winning creative studio. Uniquely crafted in a new look and style that will showcase the fact that “nounish” does not just mean “pixelated”. Unique packaging and interactive elements will make this series stand out above all other figures in this format.

**STAGE 1 (DEVELOPMENT & PRE-PRODUCTION)**

* Finalize sculptures (1 modular body, 7 heads, accessories & base stand)
* Create prototypes (1 set of 1st prints, 3 sets of paint masters / tooling patterns)
* Create paint masters (design colorways, tampo prints, 2 sets of samples & AI production files)
* Packaging design for individual boxes & display cartons & master cartons

**Stage 1 Cost Estimates**

* Design & sculpture: ~$12K (5 ETH)
* Prototypes (12 figures / 6 heads / accessories x2): ~$16K (6 ETH)
* Paint masters (12 figures / 6 heads / accessories x2): ~$16K (6 ETH)
* Packaging design (templates, die lines, color callout for production): $6K (2 ETH)
* **TOTAL STAGE 1 ESTIMATED COSTS: 18 ETH**

Klim and his team have been working on this project over the past 3 months and the final designs are fun, playful, modern and we feel represent NOUNs well in this funky new style. The sculpts are ready to go but we have gone as far as we can without help.

A more robust description of the proposal dealing with production costs and beyond is in the Google Docs.

**Stage 1 AND Stage 2 Cost Estimates**

* Pre-Production: 20ETH (Stage 1 with cushion, what is being funded in this Proposal)
* Tooling: 20-22 ETH 
* Production @ 10K units: 30 ETH
* Plus 500 ROYGBIV sets: 8 ETH
* hipping / logistics estimate: 15 ETH
* Warehousing for 1 year: 5 ETH
* **TOTAL ESTIMATE: 100 ETH**
* *Potential Success-based Bonus: 1 Noun after launch, at the DAO's discretion*

73,Nouns Around Town - a Documentary Film Proposal from the makers of Robot Chicken,"# Nouns Around Town - a Documentary Film Proposal from the makers of Robot Chicken

We propose producing a comedic documentary film about the groundbreaking nature of the Nouns DAO and the web3 community and our weird journey of getting the Nouns featured in the Rose Parade. The Noun community has shown itself to be forward thinking, enterprising, generous, warm, funny and bold. Everything from donating to Ukraine, making eye glasses for the underprivileged, to being featured in a Super Bowl ad. This is a story worth telling!

This project will be unique for three reasons:

1. Stoopid Buddy has spent years developing a very specific comedic tone we want to bring to this documentary. The doc will tell the story of the Nouns community and all the amazing initiatives it supports, but will be anchored with a strong narrative - the journey of getting the Nouns into the Rose Parade as the first ever NFT featured. This narrative lends itself to keeping things fun, silly and strange, while providing a strong hook to tether the larger story of Nouns.
2. As part of the documentary story, we'll be building and featuring six life-size walk around Noun costumes that will spread the Noun ethos through activities the community will have a say in driving. Do we want them handing out glasses? Giving random hugs to people in Times Square? Running in a charitable half marathon? We'll have fun and create great content for the documentary, all while showcasing how the DAO works.
3. Our story will revolve around the journey to get a giant, vibrant Noun float in the Pasadena Rose Parade in 2023. The film will reach a climactic end with the six life size Nouns partying their way down the Rose Parade with a massive Noun float in tow!

_Tone_

We're inspired by docs like ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" which was light, playful, and blurred the line between real and imagined. We want to tell this story in an imaginative way, often with tongue firmly in cheek.

_Why?_

We are inspired by this community and think the world needs to know how amazing and revolutionary this DAO is. We also think this is a great way to get this organization and brand out to a much wider audience. The Rose Parade will create tens of millions of impressions but the documentary will give this story life and legs and tee up the Nouns to further their reach into mainstream pop culture.

_Who are we?_

We are [Stoopid Buddy Stoodios](https://www.leagueofbuddies.com/). Most of you might know us from our flagship series, [Robot Chicken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuWZzOusVJ8), but we're also the studio behind Marvel's MODOK, Crossing Swords on Hulu, and all the costumes on FOX's [Masked Singer](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/the_masked_singer-characters-publicity-split-h_2019.jpg). And the studio that built a 15 foot walk around for [League of Legends](https://www.leagueofbuddies.com/news/buddy-builds-at-pax-east/). We've been nominated for over [22 Emmys](https://www.emmys.com/shows/robot-chicken) and won six of them. We've also won Cleo Awards for our advertising work and have worked with brands from DC, Marvel, Walking Dead, Star Wars, LEGO, Target, and [Denny's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBLThhKIoFM) among many others. All that is to say we know how to translate the spirit of a brand into entertainment. We're also the studio that last year built a life-size walk around goat Noun that made [an appearance at NFT.NYC](https://twitter.com/grelysian/status/1456665812182487048). While our ambition for the next round of life size Nouns is even greater, this experience was amazing, and a source of inspiration for what's to come.

But we don't want to do this alone. We want to bring the entire Nouns community together to help tell this story. We've been amazed by the early positive support of this proposal and are excited to engage with you all. Nouners will have the opportunity to participate by voting on where these life size ""Nouns in the Wild"" go on their journey, and even participate by walking along with other Nouns in the actual Rose Parade. The documentary will feature interviews with Nounders and Nouners alike, and highlight projects that have been successfully funded and what type of impact they've made. This will be a movie making experience that engages the entire community.

*MULTISIG*

The proposed budget + 15% to cover volatility will be released in ETH to a 2 of 3 multisig with signers 4156, gremplin, and 9999. The ETH will be immediately converted to USDC, and everything in excess of the original budget, minus 1 ETH to cover gas for the life of the multisig, will be returned to the DAO. If, due to high volatility, insufficient ETH is available to cover the proposed budget, a second proposal will top up the multisig at a later date.

*TOTAL*

23k + 400k + 330k + 450k = 1,203,000

# Sponsor a 3 car team for the Fia World Rally Championships

*This year, June the 24th-27th,the sixth leg of the World Rally Championship will be going down in Kenya. The event is the highest discipline of rallying governed by FIA.*

*Being a native of Kenya, I decided to take into my care a team of 3 drivers both of who have extensive experience and have boasted great results in the rallies they have participated in. Mr Andrew Muiruri, the lead driver, who started his career under the FIA young stars and his co-driver Mr.Edward, one of the most experienced rally drivers in the Southern hemisphere, boasting over 51 podium finishes over a period of over 10 years ,by sponsoring them with 3 stock cars for modification,and to get them registration to be able to participate in the World Rally Championship.*

[![Fia](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/044a29041eb3f76db7e423bd85fc93b1c9823b00.jpeg)](https://www.fia.com/events/world-rally-championship/season-2022/2022-world-rally-championship)

# Proposal
*I am proposing that my racing team partner with the Nouns in the World Rally Championship Safari Rally that is scheduled for the 24th of June. The initial ask is a one-time off cost and the rally team will be able to participate in future events (upto 20 events) for the next three years thereabout for almost a tenth or less of the current ask. (aprx 8-12 ETH)*

# Benefits

*This will be the first time any NFT project has participated in Rally sports, more so the biggest Rally event in the world, generating lots of publicity from people in and out of the Crypto fraternity. The same event last year generated 832 million impressions world-wide, from streaming sites(Red Bull TV, WRC+).*

*•Nounified branding of team race cars and gear.
•Registration costs paid to the WRC.
•Servicing the cars to the performance and safety standards required by FIA.
•Multiple ad work and promotion during and before the event.
•Mechanical and car service.
•Filming personnel.
•Travel and accommodation expenses for the racing team
Event Mechanics personnel.
•Spare parts.*

## Media & Coverage
*The event will be broadcasted on more than 30 live sports channels in over 50 countries all over the world. The Kenyan leg of the rally garnered 832 million impressions, putting up higher numbers than the Super Bowl and the Champions League. Streaming services such as Red Bull TV and WRC+ will also stream the event live.*

## WRC Rally Car
*WRC Rally cars are built to the standards stipulated in the FIA WRC Sporting Regulations Handbook. All participating Rally Cars are inspected by FIA, the governing body,to make sure they are up to safety and performance standards to the letter.*

*Like all competition cars, a rally car features a roll cage, upgraded suspension and a strong braking system. In order to pound rough roads at high speeds, however, they require sturdier parts.
Beefier engine mounts ensure the block won’t shake loose on bumpier road sections, while a thick aluminium skid plate prevents sharp rocks from lacerating an otherwise vulnerable oil pan. Meanwhile, bespoke wheels and tyres are essential for dealing with varied, challenging terrain.*

*Today’s WRC cars are built to the specification set by the international motorsports governing body the FIA.In 2011, rules for WRC cars became more restrictive. Cars were smaller models and exotic materials such as titanium, magnesium and composite were forbidden expect when present in the base model. Initially, gear changes had to be made with a mechanical system, so the use of paddle shifters was not allowed, however this was reversed in 2015.*

*In 2017, manufacturers were given more freedom to maximise aerodynamic performance, while the turbo restrictor diameter was increased from 33 mm to 36 mm, increasing the engine’s power output from 310 bhp to 380 bhp.*


## Promotion and Nounified Onsite Clothing & Accessories
*During the course of the Rally all members of Team Nouns will be donning some form of nounified apparel. The Rally driver’s and their co-drivers, the mechanics and the engineers (Service team) will wear noun safari hats or baseball hats to shield themselves from the scorching African sun.
The team will also be supplied with nounified towels to use after completing each leg. Any sort of supplies will also be carried around the site in nounified duffels. We plan to give away loads of t-shirts and umbrellas to willing spectators. Hoodies will be worn by the team throughout their stay in and out of venue*

## Outdoor Advertising
*There will be a total of 3 ads bearing Nouns DAO selected media. One billboard, one vide adboard and a projection mapping on the Kenya International Conference Centre*

76,Allocate Noun to Lil Nouns DAO,"# Allocate Noun to Lil Nouns DAO

This proposal allocates Noun#253 (currently held by the NounsDAO treasury) to the Lil Nouns DAO treasury.


Rationale:

Lil Nouns has demonstrated product market fit, a demand for Nouns exposure at a lower price point, and well-aligned community values.

Nouns DAO receives 10% of Lil Nouns supply for first 5 years, which brings additional utility to the Nouns treasury.

Lil Nouns has broadcast intent to use treasury funds to acquire Nouns, but additionally granting a Noun will demonstrate that we value:
- the ownership stake they have granted NounsDAO
- the positive externalities they have created for the Noun ecosystem

Noun grants in the future to derivative projects should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis

___

# TL;DR
___

Here is Nerman: [https://twitter.com/nermanbot](https://twitter.com/nermanbot)

![](https://i.imgur.com/bZhHfhr.png)

Nerman is a community bot for Nouns. Nerman can also be a great friend. A shoulder to cry on. A guiding light.

In Discord he will help with coordinating group votes on DAO proposals (ie Nouncil), informal Nouner polling, offer helpful commands, post all relevant Nouns DAO activity, and allow the community to easily share content to Social Media. On Twitter he will listen for Nounish content and cleverly decide what is the top content to reshare.

Nerman will be open source, and Nounish communities can clone him and tap into the Nouns protocol within their own Discords. Every subdao with a Nouns vote needs a Nerman. Every subdao with twitter needs a Nerman curating their feed.

**DELIVERABLES**
Two Discord bots, a Twitter social listening bot, two websites, and a distribution ready open source library.

**TIMELINE**
6 Months (multiple collaborators)

**BUDGET**

69.420 ETH

# 2. PREAMBLE
___

Earlier this year we received [support from Small Grants](https://lobalglobal.notion.site/Proposal-Nerman-1-0-f37a8407e49641a5b5f2d8f2c6ff334c) to develop Nerman 1.0 - a basic version of Nerman with social sharing and simple Discord commands. Nerman 1.0 is alive and well!

- Currently running in private server
- Manually retweeted and shared ~3000 Nounish posts as [NermanBot](https://twitter.com/nermanbot) 
- Curated 4 Twitter lists: [Nouners](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1495232888249491456), [Nouncillors](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1498451834545086470), [Nounish Projects](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1494410570161926147), [Nounish Content Mines](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1473482057246408707)

To showcase Nerman we released [Lil Nerman](https://twitter.com/LilNerman), a development bot currently running in NIL Discord.
 - will reshare Discord post content to  when :nerman: emoji used
 - has basic commands (/noun and /nouner)

We have also completed a first version of [Noun O'Clock bot](https://nounoclock.wtf/) that anyone can add. It is currently running in NIL and NounsDAO Japan.
 - shows time to Noun O'Clock in bot status
 - posts link to [FOMONouns.wtf](https://fomonouns.wtf) at Noun O'Clock 

___

# 2. DISCORD BOT - NERMAN

___

The Nerman Discord bot can help with internal governance and polling, sharing community news to the world, connecting people, lending a hand. A true friend.

**2. A.) DISCORD - SIMPLE VOTING**

Nouncil / subdaos all use emoji polls to vote on Nouns DAO proposals. It's messy and a lot of work. Nerman can fix this.

**Problems - Discord Emoji Polls**
 - people can vote for more than one option
 - if emoji votes are public, anybody can add reactions. Because of this you have to manually go through and manually tally results.
 - people can add unwanted emojis, cluttering the poll.
 - when the vote is finished you have to manually mark it closed and post the results.
 - the results aren't stored in a database, and there are no broad statistics calculated from them

**Simple Voting - Features**

 - allow / disallow voting based on Discord roles (public, Nouner, Nouncillor...)
 - votes can be anonymous, or public. For anon votes participation will still be tracked but actual vote content won't be stored
 - can enforce one vote per user, or allow multiple
 - specify an end time
 - live visual feedback, which can be turned on or off
 - uses Discords new button API
 - stores votes in a database in preparation for future web apps that display voting stats
 - basic API for db queries so others can build with this data

**FUTURE GOALS**
 - consider further voting methods: weighted voting, ranked choice, quadratic. Can any reliably be done from Discord?
 - manage and deploy votes from web app
 - create Snapshot vote and post to Discord
 - possibly automate executing Nouns DAO vote

___

**2. B.) DISCORD - SOCIAL SHARING**
___

Nounish Discords are contain a stream of Nounish content, creators put their soul into noggley creations and the world needs to see it. Nerman can fix this.

In V1.0 we implemented basic social sharing, active in the NIL Discord and the [@LilNerman](https://twitter.com/lilnerman) account. 

**FEATURES - COMPLETED**
 - user reacts ""Nerman"" emoji, Nerman responds with ""NERMAN_BLAST"" 
 - text & media (image, gif, video) are formatted appropriately for twitter
 - threshold function that determines how many votes needed to share

**FEATURES - NEW**
 - better media handling, adding support for large videos and any other misc media that needs to be formatted and handled for Twitter
 - create Nerman social media accounts on other platforms (instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn). Format it appropriately and post it there as well
 - test thoroughly and improve error handling and messages
 - if user's post is just a tweet, allow Nerman to simply retweet
 - further develop Twitter thread functionality for long text posts
 - test the Threshold functionality with live public, tweak and dial in
 - experiment with Threshold calculations in an active Discord


___

 **2. C.) DISCORD - COMMANDS**
___

Some people live in Discord.They live and breath Discord. They don't want to go on the *internet* to find Nounish facts and assets, they want it In-The-Chat. Nerman can... ah, whatever, you get it.

V1.0 Nerman implemented the following commands using https://noun.pics

**/noun [id]**
Returned a PNG of the specified Noun in an ephemeral response.

![](https://i.imgur.com/HZ4GiRE.png)


**/nouner [address or ENS]**
Returned a grid showing the Nouns owned by that address.

![](https://i.imgur.com/vXxFXUs.png)


**FEATURES - NEW**
We will switch to the Nouns DAO subgraph and offer more details.

 - /nerman noun [id]
Can display a more detailed ephemeral message about the Noun. It could possibly include: a PNG image, the last sale price, current owner, basic DAO voting stats, other Nouns owned... we will try to express the most useful content in a minimal clean way.

- /nerman nouner [address or ETH address] [include delegates]
We will change this to an ephemeral with more stats about that address, including owned Nouns and delegated Nouns. Possibly things like auctions won, etc.

- Other Useful General commands
We’d like to add further useful commands as we think of them, while also not clogging up the Nouns command space. We will experiment!


---

  **2 D.) DISCORD - BOT MESSAGES**

---

Nerman will be active in the Discord posting useful things about the State of Nouns, social media, and anything else he can chime in on.

**FEATURES**

 - When a new Nouner !joins Nerman will provide a welcome package with all links and instructions required to enjoy their Nouns experience.
 - When someone wins an auction Nerman will look on ENS for connected Social Media accounts and try to tag them with a Warm Welcome when possible
 - All State of Nouns events will be available with nice formatting: new auction, bids, auction end, new DAO proposal, proposal executed, etc
 - Notifications whenever a Noun is transferred - if it occurs on a marketplace with an API (OpenSea, LooksRare, Zora) we will provide appropriate metadata like price
 - These notifications will be configurable - work with the commmunity to figure out which ones are useful, turn the rest off
 - top daily Twitter messages

---

  **2. E.) DISCORD - ADMIN CONFIG**

---

In the beginning Nerman will only be allowed in approved Discords under the devs watchful eyes. We will tweak, and improve, and help Nerman be the best bot he can be.

Once Nerman is a well built, reliable bot, we will build out a simple config system for people to install and configure Nerman to run in any Discord and share to any social media accounts. 

**FEATURES**
 - configure which ""State of Nouns"" events post, and to which channel
 - configure which social media accounts Nerman posts too, including posting to your orgs own social media
 - where Nerman listens for posts to share to social media
 - turn options on and off (swear filter, welcome committee, etc)
 - customize messages things like the Noun O'Clock message
 - change language

---

  # 3. DISCORD BOT - NOUN O'CLOCK

---

Noun O'Clock bot is a very basic fork of Nerman that does two simple things:

 - Counts down to the next Noun O'Clock in the bot status:
![](https://i.imgur.com/w7F9c0O.png)
 - At Noun O'Clock - posts a link to [FOMO Nouns](https://fomonouns.wtf/) in the designated channel:
![](https://i.imgur.com/a0GLIjP.png)

This is currently running in several discords, including NounsDAO Japan and NIL. You can download and install the current version of Noun O'Clock here: https://nounoclock.wtf/

**NEW FEATURES**
 - Integrate new State of Nouns libray
 - Add more details to announcement link, including an image of the sold Noun, sale price, and buyer address.


---

# 4. TWITTER BOT - NERMAN LISTENER

___

Nerman surfs through social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instawhatever, etc), sharing, caring, looking for primo Nounish content to showcase. He is on a mission to automate his Twitter account. Nerman will try to figure out novel ways to find high quality Nounish content and decide which ones should be shared to [@NermanBot](https://twitter.com/nermanbot). This will take some experimentation, we have ideas but will be trying them out and continuously refining.


**FEATURES**
 - Nerman will listen on Twitter @NermanBot tags. In the beginning he will retweet all of them, and when there are too many, will develop further metrics for choosing what to Tweet.
 - Nerman will listen for common Nounish content, like ""@nounsdao"", ""#nouns"", and ""⌐◨-◨"" and share the top results.
 - Nerman will share important events from the State of Nouns, including saying hello to New Nouners when an auction finishes, 
 - Nerman will compare content from all methods and ensure only a reasonable amount of tweets are sent each day.
 - broadcast Nerman activity to additional social networks: Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn

If the DAO desires Nerman can eventually post directly to [@NounsDao](https://twitter.com/nounsdao).


___

# 5. WEBSITE - NERMAN.WTF

___

Nerman will maintain a presence in the *old web* at https://nerman.wtf. There will be some fun, basic info about Nouns DAO, a guide to following Nerman and Nouns activity, and a web app that displays voting stats from Discord polls.

**FEATURES**

 - a summary of Nerman and Nerman's activities
 - discord bot documentation
 - State of Nouns documentation
 - instructions on how to engage with Nerman on Twitter
 - links to all Nerman social media
 - breakdown of vote results and decisions made
 - breakdown of behaviour across all votes, including user behavior (if not anon) 

___

# 6. WEBSITE - NOUNOCLOCK.WTF

---
Nerman will maintain a very basic site for Noun O'Clock. It's already complete. 
[https://nounoclock.wtf/](https://)

**FEATURES**
 - a website with stuff on it. Go look

___

# 7. JS LIBRARY - STATE OF NOUNS

---

WHEN DO THINGS HAPPEN?! Nerman needs to know, and so do other Nounish bots. When a Nouns auction ends, when a proposal is created, when a Noun sells on OpenSea. Nerman needs these events, and the data associated with them.

State of Nouns is a standalone JS library for the Nounish community. Nerman will use it, and any other JS project can use it to accurately get events from all Nouns DAO activity.

Our first priority is developing this fully for Nerman. Afterwards we will package and release it as an open source, free standalone library.


**FEATURES**
 - provides access to all Nouns events across governance, NFTs, etc
 - will report all Noun transfers. Will report sale metadata if on OpenSea, LooksRare, or Zora
 - simple JS library that can be incorporated into other projects
 - user provides own Web3 connection details (supports various JSON-RPC options)
 - no centralized service, simply fork the code and run your own


---

# 8. USER ROLES & META DATA RESEARCH

---

Discord user roles are often verified with Collab.Land. Nerman will be able to function with existing User roles. 

We will experiment with other options in a separate Discord, try to find a better way. We have specific advanced Nerman functionality we want to explore. There are solutions like [The Guild](https://www.the-guild.dev/) and devcarrot's [custom idea](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/lets-build-a-better-way-to-verify-ownership/297). A simple connection to ENS would also be great.

**FUNCTIONALITY RESEARCH GOALS**
 - connect Discord username -> wallet address -> Twitter username so we can correctly tag users on Twitter when sharing. This could be a custom app, or there might be existing tools we can use.
 - NOUNS: automating ""[Nouner](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1495232888249491456)"" Twitter list to automatically add new Nouners, and remove Nouners who sell their Noun
 - if people have ENS with twitter and Discord usernames added we can tag people live as the Nouns auction bids happen, and we could send winners nice welcome messages on Twitter and Discord.
 - We will publish our findings as a guide for other communities to follow

All of these will need to be hosted and maintained over time. We will be in Discord and on Twitter paying attention to quality and listening to the community. We will publish the State of Nouns library on something like NPM, ensure it's accessible to devs, and answer questions from the community.

___

**SOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT**
___

Nerman has been active since January: https://twitter.com/NermanBot/

The account has been operated manually by Joel Cares for about 5 months now (almost 3000 RTs!) and involves scouring Twitter for content daily. We will continue this for 6 more months, until Nerman is ready to automate the content curation and take over the reigns.

Once Nerman Bot is live, we will still loosely moderate the feed to ensure quality is kept high and nothing Vile comes through. As the algorithms are tweaked to perfection this moderation will no longer be needed.

**FEATURES**
 - Constant content moderation to ensure quality
 - Manual curation of [Nounish Content Lists](https://twitter.com/NermanBot/lists) until they can be automated

___

# 10. PRIORITY USE CASES

___

Once Nerman is live these are our top priority use cases:

 - NOUNS: #nouncil-vote
   - a channel where only Nerman can post
   - votes are automatically created for every new DAO proposal
   - Nouncillors can also create votes through /nerman vote command
   - Nouncillor role has 1 vote per user
   - votes last 60 hours, after which they close and display results
   - Nouncillor manually process Gnosis Safe vote
   - simple stats to help ensure Nouncillors are participating

 - NOUNS: #nouner-poll
   - only Nerman can post
   - Nouners can create polls through /nerman command
   - Nouners have 1 vote per Noun
   - Votes have 72 hour period.
   - used for informal consensus gathering only. Used to gauge Nouner opinions, help choose between options when writing proposals, judge contests... Quick and semi-fair off-chain feedback from the Discord Nouner hive-mind.

 - TWITTER: [@NermanBot](https://twitter.com/nermanbot)
     - automate content curation

[Discourse Proposal](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/make-nouns-glasses-visible-from-space-part-of-the-permanent-record-google-earth-maps/1126)

**Request for 150 ETH to:**
1. Fund installation of Nouns glasses VISIBLE FROM EARTH ORBIT
2. Serve as venue retainer for future Nouns IRL events
3. Establish Nouns DAO as a founding supporter of charity beer garden that will utilize the space
4. Provide drone photography of finished project and initiate media coverage

**Benefits:**
1. Imprint Nouns upon the permanent record via Google Earth, Google Maps, etc.
2. Retain two venues for IRL Nouns events in the US Midwest
3. Reinforce the Nouns ethos by supporting a community-oriented charity event series
4. Raise Nouns awareness and proliferation potential on a previously unrealized scale

![Event Space](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/0/0d7ffadc9ee9fe961e06d937ecc2a31cf2273d46.jpeg ""Event Space"")

The DAO has already funded a Nouns expedition space and the ISS. This proposal will MAKE NOUNS VISIBLE FROM SPACE by installing a pair of Nouns glasses large enough that they’ll be seen from orbit and for long enough to be included when satellite maps are updated in Google Earth/Maps, etc. They’ll become part of the permanent record, visible even to normies that don’t frequent NFT social media. The glasses will appear less
than 300 yards from the largest stadium in the US (third largest in the world) and one of the largest universities — a destination for hundreds of thousands every year. It’s also an area that has undergone major municipal and private development over the past 12 months so updates to online maps are sure to follow.

Nouns funding will fulfill multiple goals simultaneously: the biggest and most visible being the massive Nouns glasses, obvious not only to online navigators but to in-person visitors and media providing ground & aerial coverage during sporting events. The glasses will be included as part of a synthetic turf upgrade at the site and will align with a North-oriented map display for a natural viewing angle. Replacing the natural lawn with
synthetic turf will improve durability at the site and preserve the Nouns glasses long enough for the next satellite maps update to take place.

Funding will also serve as a retainer for Nouns IRL events in a Midwest US city accustomed to large gatherings and a short drive from an international air hub. The Nouns community is welcome at the charity beer garden and can also request a private visit. Nouns DAO will have access to a 10,000 square foot outdoor site and a
premium residential venue for any dates not reserved for charity events).

Installation of the Nouns glasses at the site will identify Nouns DAO as an advocate for community-oriented events in public spaces and will benefit a well-established charity beer garden that began at this location in 2016. The family-friendly public tailgate successfully attracted tens of thousands of patrons each season (before a pandemic hiatus) and grossed six figures for cancer programming.

A licensed drone photographer will capture photos of the Nouns glasses in situ so that images and Nouns backstory may be included in a press release for local and national media. The owner/manager of the charity event spent 26 years as a professional photographer and has numerous media and connections, including a spouse in the publishing and PR industry.",CANCELLED,14807625,14827335,0,31,,0,0,0,312,5,45,30,['150000000000000000000'],['0x3765d1527dc0e18aa6e1845597395b430315d94b'],[''],14794485,1652816978,0xe5920741e23cc3ba037af9204dfaaba07ceb64fe7516de048183c1ffc9a38e0b,['0x'],0xf8a065f287d91d77cd626af38ffa220d9b552a2b

*Copied from [Nouns Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-children-s-book-development/1231/11) on behalf of @brandonmighty*

Hey Nouners,

You may have seen me (Brandon James Scott / @brandonmighty) on twitter or around the discord. I’ve been making Nouns-inspired art like my [Myth of Noun collection on Superrare](https://superrare.com/series/0xca4607aad52f654cf6357895c397094c077a3236) and my [Nouns at Work collection on Foundation ](https://foundation.app/collection/nounsatwork).

![](https://i.imgur.com/N70U3r8.jpg)

*The Myth of Noun & Nouns at Work collections*

I am an artist with over fifteen years of experience in children’s entertainment via animation and publishing. I’m writing this proposal because I think the world needs a Nouns children’s book - and I’d like to make one.

**Goals**
Introduce the fun, positive energy of Nouns to a young audience (and their parents). Create a wonderful nounish illustrated experience in physical form. Open a path to the traditional publishing world for Nouns.

![](https://i.imgur.com/biSbsDm.jpg)

**I am a Noun**

I am a Noun (tentative title) will be an illustrated book for young children where we meet, learn about, laugh with, laugh at, argue with, understand, admire and ultimately love the Nouns. It will read like a curious journey with occasional reader involvement instead of a traditional linear story. For those familiar with children’s books, think along the lines of Julie Morstad’s Today, Oliver Jeffer’s Here We Are, or Richard Scarry’s Best Word Book Ever - these books take a big idea and explore them visually and nonlinearly.

The book may start with asking a simple question to the reader: What is a noun? Our Nouns characters will have their opinions on this, which will lead to more questions, and more opinions - often at odds with each other and the narrator, with the reader stuck in the middle of it all. The book will be curious, funny, smart, absurd, and nounish… always. And it might end with another question for the reader: What kind of noun will you be?

You already have an idea of what it might look like. I don’t see the book as fully painted as my Myth of Noun pieces - probably more minimal like Nouns at Work with characters on simple backgrounds. And like the art I’ve done, I will base as much as possible on official Nouns traits. I’ll also be adding new characters (people, places, things…) and will put the Nouns glasses on almost everything.

It should be noted that the story will not directly reference the dao, nfts, crypto, ect. I would consider this project a very gentle trojan horse for nouns for a brand new audience.

I will also encourage and welcome any input from the Nounders as I develop this story to keep the nounish vibes in check. ⌐◨-◨

**Package**

This is not funding for a finished book, but rather funding for the development of a book submission package. Once a successful submission and sale takes place, the publisher would acquire publishing rights and offer an advance so that I may finish the rest of the book.

I have literary representation (Emily Van Beek at Folio Jr. literary agency) who has already shown interest and encouraged me to pursue this idea. I will work with her to fine tune this submission and once we’re both confident that it’s ready, she will work on my behalf to find a publisher for it.

I’d like funding from the DAO so I can devote time to write, illustrate and develop this idea into a package that would include:

* A finished manuscript
* A book ‘dummy’ (a sketched out layout of the full book)
* 2-3 pages of finished art
* Cover art

This amount of material makes up a strong package which solidifies all the main creative decisions (the concept, the story, the content and flow of the pages, and the final art style) for a confident submission.

The goal would be to have material ready to submit to publishers in fall 2022.

**Funds Requested**

15 ETH

**Caveats**

* There is a small possibility that the normy publishing world may struggle to support a project based on a nft collection, or using a public domain ‘brand’, or because we just don’t get it all those weird heads. I don’t believe any of these things will happen because A) I believe I can create a wonderful, unique book that publishers will want, and B) I love the Nouns, and I believe many others will too.
* I’ll be relying on my agent for her experience and advice with regard to submitting, and any and all publishers, from the big 5 to smaller indie publishers may be considered. In the event that a traditional publishing deal proves difficult, self-publishing could be another option, in which case I would return to the DAO to explore further funding for production and distribution with a separate proposal.
* The DAO should anticipate that any book published with a traditional publisher will most likely end up in a more traditional copyright situation and not CC0.

**TL;DR** - I’m asking for 15 ETH to develop a robust submission package for a Nouns children’s book for traditional publishing.

**About Me**
I’ve worked for over 15 years in animation as an art director, director and creative director at Guru Studio on a range of hit animated series including Paw Patrol, True and the Rainbow Kingdom, Pikwik Pack, and Mecha Builders. I’m also the creator of my own series, the Emmy-nominated Justin Time.

I’m the illustrator of I Was Born a Baby and I Live in a Tree Trunk with Harper Collins, A Bear, a Bee, and a Honey Tree with Astra Publishing/Hippo Park, Cow Says Meow with HMH, Snow Falls with Penguin Random House/Tundra Books, and The Dog Who Wanted to Fly with Annick Press. I am represented by Emily Van Beek at Folio Jr. 1 literary agency.

## tl;dr

### Nounders. Nouners. And Nounish Friends.

As Nouns continues to strive to be a household name throughout the world, our team began to think, let us not lose our tie to our everyday life. We are not necessarily here to use our digital space as a means to escape the real world, but rather, as a means to improve it. An ethos and belief that we know many Nouners also feel.

With this in mind and our team’s love and experience in the international coffee industry, we come to the DAO and the Nouns Community with a proposal for Nouns Coffee, the first ever Nounish consumable brand. With hopes of being on the shelves of your favorite cafe, local market, or frequented grocery store. With the potential of someday having special real world locations at the corner of your favorite neighborhood to meet up and sip a cup with some of your closest nounish friends.

### Nouns Coffee Brand
*Below you will find key details on how our team plans to bring this prolific coffee brand to life.*

## Phase One
### Coffee

- For Phase One of Nouns Coffee, the team will be sourcing a high-quality roaster in order to whitelabel for the brand. (read more about the potential plans for phase 2 and 3 later in this proposal)
- Our team will use their connections within the coffee industry to find the right partner to roast our coffee. We will work diligently to ensure the highest quality coffee. This includes virtually hosted cupping sessions where we will send the roasts around to members of the community so we can all decide on the roasts together.
- All coffee will be fair trade and organic. We care deeply about not only who drinks our coffee, but the hands that were instrumental in the planting, growing, harvesting, and roasting of our coffee.
- Phase One will include a variety of different single origins as well as a variety of blends so that all of our nounish palettes are satisfied and caffeinated (and decaffeinated for you weirdos).

### Ecommerce

- In order to get Nouns Coffee into as many cups as possible, we will build an ecommerce site in order to streamline operations and provide trustworthy purchasing and shipping of Nouns Coffee.
- This will be inclusive of a custom web experience reflective of the existing Nouns brand, to ensure a cohesive experience.
We will most likely use Shopify along with an integration of Coinbase Commerce in order to accept payments in crypto as well.
- The team will work on Web3 integration to enable all Nounders and Nouners to access and claim certain coffees/roasts for free as part of their participation in the DAO.

### Collateral/Advertising

- Beyond just caffeinating you, we will provide you with vessels to sip from as you listen to hosted noun o’clock spaces by CDT, while at work, or out for your morning walk.
We will create custom cards to place in each order with QR codes (or similar) sending people to nouns.wtf so they can check out the daily auction while brewing their morning coffee.
- Phase One will also include the creation of other nounish collateral like tote bags to carry around your coffee, your mug, your books, your HW, you name it. We’ll work with the community to decide what pieces of collateral will be best used to show off your love for the community and your love for coffee. Proliferation is the name of the game.

### By Nouns for Nouns

- Being a Nounder/Nouner will open the door for monthly perks from Nouns Coffee. This may come in the form of monthly coffee deliveries, custom mugs and totes, and even “Noun of the Month” featured roasts where Nouners can have their Nouns featured on the packaging etc.
- Beyond being a Nounder or a Nouner, if you hold a Nouns Bidder POAP (brkfstsndwch’s first project for the DAO), you will also have the chance for added features and perks from Nouns Coffee.

### (If prop is approved by June 9th) Soft Launch at Korea Blockchain Week 2022 in August

- Possibly the greatest branding exposure at KBW2022 as attendees are
constantly searching for their next cup of coffee. Branding will include
full-colored signage at all coffee stations, and on branded napkins and
coffee sleeves.
- Thousands of eyes, and mouths, witnessing the glory of Nouns and Nouns Coffee.

### Project Timeline
#### Phase One Accelerated for Korea Blockchain Week
Full Timeline Can Be Viewed [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G1l5sQb3JRQ5C0NGSklu_KoSe4p0KWk_/view)
*Branding and Coffee Ready for KBW | 8-10 Weeks from Approval of Proposal*

#### Phase One (if not approved by June 9th)
4-8 Weeks | Roaster Sourcing for Whitelabel
4-8 Weeks | Brand Identity
6-8 Weeks | Packaging Design
4-6 Weeks | Packaging Production
6-8 Weeks | Collateral Design
6-8 Weeks | Collateral Production
6-8 Weeks | Website Design + Development
2-4 Weeks | Coffee Production (begins after roaster is sourced)
*Site is Live and First Bags Shipped | 12-18 Weeks from Approval of Proposal*

## Phase Two
*Sourcing/Roastery | Warehouse Leasing and Hiring Head Roaster*
- Upon the successful adoption of Phase One and dependent on the demand for more coffee, we will submit a second proposal to lease our own warehouse and roaster, while also hiring a head roaster to roast and produce our own coffee.
- The pros to this are the eventuality of bringing down costs, allowing us to keep our quality high, and giving us the opportunity to produce at scale.
- A successful Phase Two will also set us up with a better position to execute on Phase Three (read below).
- More details will of course be shared with the Nouns Community throughout Phase One as we begin thinking towards a Phase Two.

## Phase Three
*Nouns Cafe*
- A real world cafe, bringing the meme to life. Imagine you are walking down the cobblestone streets of soho and you look to your right to see a bright red figure appear, to realize it’s a pair of noggles. The sweet aroma of nougat, chamomile, and chocolate fill the air. It pulls you in. Taking a step through the door, you see a few patrons sporting Salvino Armati’s noggles, clinking their Nounish mugs, and bidding on the auction for the day.

Proposal by Noun 22

The Retroactive Funding and Small Grants Pool is running low on ETH and needs to be refilled.

# Nouns x Vector DAO: Secret Nouns 1/1s drop at NFT NYC
Nouns ℅ Vector DAO Proposal 

## Summary
Vector DAO will commission 8 artists in our community to design a series of unique Nouns artworks and print them on 200+ extra-large (6ft high!) wheatpaste posters around New York City for NFT NYC. Each unique poster design will be posted in a grid of 8 (all 8 posters will be the same artwork), with different designs being posted in their own grid of 8 across different locations, creating a scavenger like hunt to collect all 8 artworks.

Each poster will have a QR code that will allow individuals to mint 1 of 150 limited editions of each artwork. There will be 1,200 total mints at a price of 0.15 ETH each. All primary and secondary sales will go to the Vector DAO treasury to be used to purchase a Noun, replenishing the Nouns treasury. Any remaining ETH post Nouns acquisition will be split among the artists and team. As a stretch goal, we will try to support having the first 25 mints of each artwork be free, allowing this drop to be accessible to more people – this will depend on our ability to find an elegant sybil resistant solution in time.

Vector will provide photographers to take photos of all the posters to share on social to boost visibility (blurring out the QR code) as well as write an article about our collaboration experience with Nouns DAO to help future creators make proposals.

## What’s in it for Nouns DAO?
### Spread the Nouns meme
- We're putting up 200 giant posters (6ft tall) around NYC during a high visibility week + taking photos to share online
- The artwork will be done by a roster of top tier artists with their own audience and community
- There's a fun game attached to being the first to find the posters and mint the limited NFTs, creating a viral loop to share back online
- Vector DAO will use proceeds from the mint to purchase a Noun, forming a long term relationship between Vector and Nouns, helping replenish the treasury, and cementing the culture of paying it forward to more nounish builders

### Pave a path for more creatives to contribute to Nouns
- We'll bring 8 really amazing artists into the Nouns universe, who will then talk about it with their friends, driving more high caliber builders to the Nouns universe
- This also forms a relationship with Vector DAO, a community of 80 super strong makers who are excited to further contribute to nouns
- We'll write an article about the entire process to help onboard more makers into the community

_And more (pending proposal approval)_

## The concept: Independent, together
![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/bYQ8hIH.jpg)
_(Similar concept for Art Basel in 2021)_

We’re commissioning 8 artists with distinct styles to create a series of posters remixing Nouns, showcasing each artist’s unique styles and perspectives (illustration, 3D, typography, color, etc). To create a consistent visual motif across the posters, the artwork must feature a Nouns artifact, but interpreted however the artist sees fit. Vector will have these artworks printed on 200+ wheatpaste posters and posted around the NFT NYC conference in Times Square and in neighborhoods like Williamsburg and SoHo.

Each poster will have a QR code where viewers can mint 1 of 150 limited edition NFTs of that poster’s artwork. Each NFT edition will have a mint price of 0.15 ETH and be sold using the [Zora Protocol](https://create.zora.co/).

We hope the end product not only propagates the Nouns brand and reflects the power of placing goods in the public domain, but also the power of individuals in forming digital communities like Vector to create across both digital and physical mediums.

## About Vector DAO
Vector DAO is a collective of artists, designers, and developers in web3. Our mission is to give individuals autonomy over all aspects of their work from lifestyle and creative freedom to team and compensation. We believe in a future where creatives and makers aren’t tied to any one employer but can freely contribute to communities, like Nouns, that excites them. We believe in the power of working independently, together. That means members run their own independent practices but share resources, risks, and opportunities as a community, working together in groups when projects call for it, or individually at other times. Over time, Vector hopes to prove this new model of working that other communities and builders can replicate, sustainably working for public goods and moving web3 forward.

## Budget
200 Wheatpaste posters in Times square, Williamsburg, SoHo [1]: **20 ETH ($36,000)**
8 Independent artists’ commission [2]: **100 ETH ($180,000)**
NFT mint mini-site design & dev [2]: **10 ETH ($18,000)**
Contribution process blog post w/ photos [2]: **0 ETH**

![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/fJ9nndG.png)
_(Microsoft Surface Mural, Jasper Wong)_

## TL;DR
Let’s bring Nouns to the world through a global art tour starting with Nouns IRL in NYC! This activation will take place during NFT NYC (June 20 – 23) and will feature:
- Hand painted mural by Jasper Wong who is an artist and founder of Worldwide Walls (http://www.powwowworldwide.com/ 3), the mural will be viewable from June 20 – July 10 and will promote NFT culture by highlighting several well known projects with Nouns at the center.
- Simple website / landing page to commemorate the mural

**The activation is estimated to generate ~2.5M impressions. The total amount being requested is 87.5 ETH.**

## Why Should You Care? 
We can all agree that art is a pretty powerful communicator; it appeals to our emotions, forces us to think, and does a pretty good job of bringing us together on some level. We hope to use this power to accomplish the following: 
- Increase awareness of Nouns at NFT NYC—online and IRL
- Increase brand awareness of the Nouns DAO as a leader in the industry;
- Invite NFT enthusiasts and the public at large to become involved with the Nouns DAO community. We want to let people know that we are here and we invite them to come build the future with us; and,
- Create a website (nounsirl.live) that tells the story behind the art (plan is to also include art from other cities on the tour)
  - High-res images and time lapse video of the mural, artist’s explanation etc.
  - Links to Nouns website, twitter, discord, etc.  

## Nouns IRL — Person, Place, Thing
Nouns: person, place, thing… We thought that it would be really cool to bring this concept to IRL via fun and engaging art activations around the world. Each stop on the tour will feature a specific artist (or group of artists), a city, and an interesting Nounified art piece. Imagine Nouns on Venice Beach, or Nouns on a rehabilitated basketball court in Chicago. Imagine the looks on people’s faces if a huge inflated Noun floated by them in Miami. These art activations will vary in flight time from several weeks to several months, with the goal being to create longer lasting pieces that become a part of the cultural backdrop in the city. There are a ton of things we can explore on this tour and we think NFT NYC would be a perfect place to start. 

## Person
Jasper Wong, founder of [Worldwide Walls](https://www.instagram.com/powwowworldwide/?hl=en).

Jasper Wong is an artist, illustrator, curator and art director; his art style can be described as a unique clash of Asian-influenced pop culture on paper. Jasper has exhibited worldwide in places such as Japan, California, France, London, Mexico, New York, Hong Kong, Chicago, and Australia. Jasper is also extremely accomplished having been chosen as one of the HB100, a list of Hypebeast’s 100 most influential figures in the industry, which includes the likes of Kaws, Pharrell, Banksy, Jay Z and Kanye West.

Jasper is a big fan of Nouns, he has been following the project for some time and is very excited at the opportunity to get involved with the DAO. In addition to painting the mural, Jasper will be sending out Nouns-related messages on his social media platforms to engage his followers before and during the mural’s flight time. Jasper is also very well known within the art community and will attempt to leverage his network to invite some of his artist friends to hang out with him at the completed mural during NFT NYC. The goal will be to use both Jasper and his artist friends’ followers to generate additional traffic at the mural and further amplify social media impressions.

Jasper is very involved with the community through his non-profit organisation Pow! Wow! of which he is the creator and lead director. Pow! Wow! is a group of contemporary artists committed to community enrichment through the creation of art outreach programs, educational programs, and engaging the community in the creation and appreciation of art. Pow! Wow! has executed projects (murals, school renovations, basketball courts, etc.) in 13 cities around the globe, such as Honolulu, Taipei, Tokyo, Nepal, Guam, Seoul, Israel, and others.

## Place
New York City during NFT NYC, the Super Bowl of NFT conferences.

NFT NYC is the perfect staging ground for the first Nouns IRL activation. One of the stated missions of the DAO is to attract builders/creatives who are ready to create products that proliferate the Nouns brand to a wider audience and shed positive light on the concept of DAOs. NFT/crypto enthusiasts attending NFT NYC are a perfect target for this mission as many are informed about the space and are also builders/creatives looking for a project to support. The general public present in New York at this time will be surrounded by a ton of NFT related themes which should generate interest and curiosity. Many of these people (who may also be builders/creatives) have not yet fully explored the crypto space, this will be an opportunity to capture their attention and encourage them to become involved with Nouns DAO.

## Thing
Sharable hand painted mural art piece promoting NFT culture (optimised for social sharing on Twitter and Instagram) and website.

We have encouraged Jasper to create a mural in his style that is a conversational piece. The mural will act as an introduction to the crypto space for many newcomers, we hope that it inspires a sense of curiosity and an urge to dig deeper. For those in the know, the mural will act as a proverbial nod of acknowledgment to the projects that have made an impact and have shed a positive light on the crypto space in general. The mural will showcase popular CC0 and non-CC0 projects such as BAYC, Doodles, Moonbirds, Cryptoads, Chain Runners, CryptoPunks, Coolcats, World of Women, Creature World, DeadFellaz, Okay Bears, etc. Each of these projects have extremely large and very loyal followings which we believe will ensure that the mural reaches the widest audience possible. The goal is to create a compelling piece which shows unity within the crypto space and inspires the viewer to get involved. 

![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/HKKgICa.png)

The mural will be located at 300 W Broadway, next to the entrance of the Soho Grand Hotel, facing the busy Holland Tunnel) and will measure 8’9” H x 16’ W in size.

As mentioned above, the ultimate goal is to launch a continued effort to promote Nouns worldwide through art. NYC is the first stop of the tour. The Nouns IRL website will act as an artefact for this and all future activations. The website will contain high-res images, time lapse video, artist bio, story behind the art, and links to the discord, the main Nouns website, discourse, etc. 

## Budget (all figures are in USD):
- Mural Wall: $62,000.00:
A soft hold was placed on the mural location until the 27th of May; we are in communication with the mural company about extending the hold for at least another week. If we are able to keep the current location, the cost for the wall will be $36,000.00. The $62,000.00 amount is a rough quote for an alternate location. We are in communication with the wall company to determine if cheaper locations are available. We are more than willing to return any funds that we did not end up needing to use to secure the wall.
- Artist: $40,000.00
- Team: $25,000.00
- Nouns IRL Landing page + capturing of video and photos for social: $11,000.00
- Travel / Accommodations: $6,000.00

**Total: $144,000.00, total ETH ask: 87.5 ETH**
_Based on $1,700.00 price of ETH as of May 27, 2022; we have added 2.5 additional ETH to try and account for volatility and fees._

## Team
This activation is being executed by the [Nouns Collective](https://twitter.com/Nounscollectiv3) (formerly the Collective DAO) which is a liquid super team made up of friends building playful, useful, and beautiful products and experiences with the crypto communities they love. We have previously contributed to the community via the [Nouns iOS app](https://www.nounsapp.wtf/) (proposal 6) which was officially launched on May 16, 2022. The Nouns Collective is composed of experienced founders, brand builders, and developers with over 15 years of experience building successful products. 

For this activation we have teamed up with [@miss_singh](https://twitter.com/Miss_Singh) who is a creative professional, cultural connector, community builder, experiential expert, and entrepreneur. @miss_singh has over two decades of experience that spans industries from tech, marketing, fashion and retail with her most recent gig being with Shopify. @miss_singh is extremely excited to jump into the Web3 world with us and looks to use her considerable experience and talents to deliver a memorable and lasting experience.

## To be Nountinued…

We are super excited to merge Nouns with IRL. The Nouns community is strong and vibrant; we hope to show the world who we are and what we are about. The best way to onboard more individuals, especially builders, into the space is to meet them where they are. DAOs, NFTs, blockchains, this can all be difficult to grasp for newcomers. Using familiar / traditional mediums of delivery (pop-ups, art, events, etc.) to introduce these concepts are an effective way to drive engagement. We hope that this stop on the tour will be the first of many to come!

One of the stated missions of the DAO is to attract builders/creatives who are ready to create products that proliferate the Nouns brand to a wider audience and shed positive light on the concept of DAOs. NFT/crypto enthusiasts attending NFT NYC are a perfect target for this mission as many are informed about the space and are also builders/creatives looking for a project to support. The general public present in New York at this time will be surrounded by a ton of NFT related themes which should generate interest and curiosity. Many of these people (who may also be builders/creatives) have not yet fully explored the crypto space, this will be an opportunity to capture their attention and encourage them to become involved with Nouns DAO.

## Thing
Sharable hand painted mural art piece promoting Nouns and a simple website.

We have encouraged Jasper to create a mural in his style that is a conversational piece. The mural will act as an introduction to the crypto space for many newcomers, we hope that it inspires a sense of curiosity and an urge to dig deeper. For the more experienced, the mural will act as an introduction to Nouns; we hope that it shows them the many possibilities of being involved with the DAO. The overall goal is to create a compelling piece which introduces Nouns to the viewer and inspires the viewer to get involved. 

![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/HKKgICa.png)

The mural will be located at 300 W Broadway (next to the entrance of the Soho Grand Hotel, facing the busy Holland Tunnel) and will measure 8’9” H x 16’ W in size.

As mentioned above, the ultimate goal is to launch a continued effort to promote Nouns worldwide through art. NYC is the first stop of the tour. The Nouns IRL website will act as an artefact for this and all future activations. The website will contain high-res images, time lapse video, artist bio, story behind the art, and links to the discord, the main Nouns website, discourse, etc. 

## Budget (all figures are in USD):
- Mural Wall: $36,000.00:
We have been advised by the wall company that a soft hold will be placed on the mural location for us at least until the 10th of June.
- Artist: $40,000.00
- Team: $25,000.00
- Nouns IRL Landing page + capturing of video and photos for social: $11,000.00
- Travel / Accommodations: $6,000.00

**Total: $118,000.00, total ETH ask: 72.5 ETH**
_Based on ~$1,700.00 price of ETH as of June 3, 2022; we have added ~3 additional ETH to try and account for volatility and fees._

## Team
This activation is being executed by the [Nouns Collective](https://twitter.com/Nounscollectiv3) (formerly the Collective DAO) which is a liquid super team made up of friends building playful, useful, and beautiful products and experiences with the crypto communities they love. We have previously contributed to the community via the [Nouns iOS app](https://www.nounsapp.wtf/) (proposal 6) which was officially launched on May 16, 2022. The Nouns Collective is composed of experienced founders, brand builders, and developers with over 15 years of experience building successful products. 

For this activation we have teamed up with [@miss_singh](https://twitter.com/Miss_Singh) who is a creative professional, cultural connector, community builder, experiential expert, and entrepreneur. @miss_singh has over two decades of experience that spans industries from tech, marketing, fashion and retail with her most recent gig being with Shopify. @miss_singh is extremely excited to jump into the Web3 world with us and looks to use her considerable experience and talents to deliver a memorable and lasting experience.

## To be Nountinued…

We are super excited to merge Nouns with IRL. The Nouns community is strong and vibrant; we hope to show the world who we are and what we are about. The best way to onboard more individuals, especially builders, into the space is to meet them where they are. DAOs, NFTs, blockchains, this can all be difficult to grasp for newcomers. Using familiar / traditional mediums of delivery (pop-ups, art, events, etc.) to introduce these concepts are an effective way to drive engagement. We hope that this stop on the tour will be the first of many to come!

90,GOAT CLUB's Nounish Meme Factory,"# GOAT CLUB's Nounish Meme Factory

**TLDR;**
Order 69 nounish gifs, jpegs and mp4s for 15E from the first Nounish Meme Factory –hereby known as GOAT CLUB aka Goldy and tummlin (owners of noun #116).

![|300x300](https://media.tenor.com/images/307ba7102a129618fa4766d17a031e8b/tenor.gif)

**WHY?**
One of the founding principals of Nouns DAO is based on the thesis that backed by provenance, NFTs can be used as value capture for memes, and that therefore we should spend the treasury to proliferate Nouns as much as possible.

Nouns is digital (and internet) native, and the majority of people interacting with it are doing so on twitter and discord, so the first port of call should be to arm the nouns, and extended NFT and crypto communities with as much ammo for the meme war as possible.

![|573.526066350711x237.42583817429912](https://c.tenor.com/AIuauz6uAwUAAAAC/nouns-nouns-dao.gif)

**THE RIGHT TEAM FOR THE JOB**
Goldy has been a part of the Nouns community since early testnet, and Tummlin was lurking for a weeks before they purchased their noun together ~150 days ago. Both have already compulsively created all manner of high quality nounish, memish content, which has garnered hundreds of thousands of impressions, and been shared countless (no, literally, we don’t know how to do this) times on twitter and discord by the wider community to express their nounishness and spread the meme.

You can see gifs already by GOAT CLUB here: [https://tenor.com/users/goldypix

And more nounish content below:

**![|588x832](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mc7wudpn0zraryj/goatclubnounishness_march2022.jpeg?dl=1)**

**CONTENT**
Our vision is to focus mostly on the content we know works; we want more of it. But we also want to be flexible, and move wherever both excites us and is getting traction. Part of the process will involve some experimentation to try to find new avenues for impact, ideally we unlock new nounish ideas. We will deliver within 1-3 months.

**We will mainly focus on:**  
* Nounish remixes of reaction gifs

**With a secondary focus on:**
* Nounified static memes, cartoon/comics, and pop culture remixes
* Nounish artwork (pixel art and otherwise) with cultural references and memetic resonance.

**And we may experiment with:**
* Brand new nounish memes (as opposed to remixing existing memes)
* Lo-fi nounish videos
* …Perhaps something not yet considered

**Community requests:**
* We will create a twitter hashtag, and a channel on the nouns discord for the project (or perhaps our own discord if its neccesary) for community members to request remixes, content or share ideas.

**Bonus**
* Livestream the creation of 1-2 gifs
* Timelapse of a creation of 1-2 gifs

**ACCESS & PROLIFERATION**
We’ll upload everything we make to accessible repositories for easy use, especially those with native integrations to social platforms like Tenor and Giphy, as well as a repository of all the things we have made and will continue to make (Google Drive or Dropbox etc.)

We’ll convert the most appropriately scaled work as Discord reactions (emotes) for extra ease of use. (Happy to either host these on a Goat Club discord server or give to Nouns DAO server admins).

We will also make dedicated efforts to share this content, as natively as possible (as well as find ways to encourage others) via twitter and discord to increase awareness of the existence of all of them. Connecting the gifs with a hashtag like #nouns or #nounify could be quite powerful.

![nounish-more|500x500](https://c.tenor.com/lCq21Mx-m0UAAAAC/nouns-nounsdao.gif)

**RISKS & REWARD**
**Worst case scenario:** 
There’s a whole bunch of new Nounish content to enjoy, share, and proliferate.

**Best case scenario:** 
We strike gold memetic gold and some content we create spreads far and wide on the internet, beyond our nounish bubble.

We’re big fans of Noun 40’s Retroactive Outsized Rewards idea in general, and we’d love for the DAO to be open to such a thing if anything we made here became a huge success (eg. millions of views etc).

Thank you Nouners and Nounees, we look forward to hearing feedback, ideas and questions.

91,Nouns DAO esports - Pokémon Unite expansion & BLVKHVND partnership trial,"# # Nouns DAO esports - Pokémon Unite expansion & BLVKHVND partnership trial

* Pokémon Unite team for 3 months
* Lots of Noun representation on twitch & youtube
* Mini documentary series following the tournament during their London trip
* Competing in $550,000USD worth of events over the next 3 months
* Trial and introduce BLVKHVND as operational partner for Nouns esports.
* Direct results and exposure between now and the end of August, no delay due from ‘building’

**Goal:**

To expand the Nouns DAO esports division operations and increase the audience reach for the nouns brand using the diverse, engaged global audience that gaming and esports presents. Additionally, to trial BLVKHVND as an operational partner for Nouns DAO esports.

**Pokémon Unite:**

Pokémon Unite released in June 2021 and is a MOBA for Nintendo Switch and Mobile. Currently the Unite Championship Series (UCS) season 1 is underway with 1 monthly final, the regional championships ($50,000USD prize pool) and the world championship ($500,000USD prize pool) remaining until the conclusion of the season.

The official Pokémon Unite twitch channel shows 36 hours streamed over the last month with an average viewer count of 2,398 and a peak viewer count of 20,574. That peak occurred during the European AEOS Cup finals, which our proposed team won first place in. Due to that we can assume that the European Regional Finals and especially the Pokemon World Championships will beat that viewer count.

**The Proposed Team:**

The proposed team we are looking to acquire is known as Random Gaming who have consistently placed 1st or 2nd in all European UCS events to date, including winning the AEOS Cup and the $20,000USD first place prize, with the top 2 teams from European Regional Championship qualifying for the World Championship on August 19th-21st in London we are confident in the team’s ability to qualify for this event.

The team consists of five players who are;

ADESu (Spain) - https://twitter.com/ADESuUnite 1 - Twitch
Redmaw (Norway) - https://twitter.com/redmaw_ 1 - Twitch
Bruv (England) - https://twitter.com/BruvHD 3 - Twitch 1
Gyz (Spain) - https://twitter.com/Cepriii 1 - Twitch
Ghatlue (Germany) - https://twitter.com/Gatlue 1 - Twitch

At the time of writing this proposal, the team in total has 976 hours streamed on twitch in the last three months with a team average of 56 viewers at any given time. Most notably is BruvHD who averages 167 viewers throughout his streams in this three month period.

**The Proposed Agreement:**

This proposal consists of a three month agreement with the team which will have them representing Nouns DAO for the remainder of the UCS. This agreement will consist of a signing bonus and funding a boot camp in London on the 15th - 20th of June in the lead up and during the European Regional Finals. This boot camp will be documented by a videographer to produce a mini series and various other forms of video content for the Nouns community to engage with and to spread Nouns around the gaming and Pokémon Unite community, we would be looking to utilize the Nouns DAO marketing studio, however we do have alternative options locally to London.

**BLVKHVND:**

BLVKHVND are the first decentralized esports organization, fielding teams through Halo, Counter Strike, Pokémon Unite, Apex Legends, Rogue Company and Blood hunt. Being knowledgeable in both the esports/gaming industry but also the web3 industry we are in a unique position to be able to contribute to this project with in depth understanding of both elements. Our involvement would be being the point of contact for the team, organizing and executing all the elements of this proposal and working alongside the existing Nouns DAO esports contributors in Sasquatch, Brennen and Brax to scale the current Nouns esports resources and continue to develop and improve the operations as well as increase our branding image and implementation of Nouns culture throughout the operation.

Our tasks include but are not limited to;

* Organizing and executing the Bootcamp in London on 15th - 20th of June, this consists of booking flights, accommodation, training facility, media for content creation and having a staff member on site to monitor and assist.
* Working with the players and media contributors to create engaging content and roll out on YouTube and Twitter.
* Monitoring events throughout the three month period and posting results to Twitter.
* Networking with the existing Pokémon Unite community to spread the Nouns brand through additional tournaments and media opportunities.
* Using BLVKHVND in-house media team in potential collaboration with the Nouns media studio to implement Nouns branding to the players social media accounts and content platforms such as youtube and twitch, this consists of banners, profile pictures and stream assets.
* Using BLVKHVND in-house media team in potential collaboration with the Nouns media studio to create engaging images and short form video to post to twitter during tournaments to drive engagement and viewership to Nouns esports tournament performances.
* Maintaining consistent communications with all the players on the team to ensure smooth operations throughout the agreement and guarantee a positive interaction between the team and Nouns esports.
* Pending qualification for Pokémon World Championships in London on August 19th - 21st, organizing all flights and accommodation in collaboration with the Pokémon Company. During the event having a staff member escorting the team to assist them with anything they require.
* Pending qualification for Pokémon World Championships in London on August 19th - 21st, organizing media for content creation surrounding the London event and working alongside them to roll out the media.
* BLVKHVND sourced the team presented in this proposal, negotiated on the proposed offer and constructed the proposal presented.
* All the expenses listed above being the labour, travel and accommodation are covered in the BLVKHVND management services fee. This includes the labour cost of designers, editors and videographers. The proposed fee will cover the full three months of operation.

**Content Creation Expenses:**

The proposed allocated amount for content creation expenses is 1.5ETH, this is to cover travel and accommodation for videographers to London for the boot camp and potentially for the Pokémon World Championship pending qualification. The videographer will be paid for their time out of the BLVKHVND management services budget, however their travel expenses are separated.

**Budget:**

3 month salary & signing bonus - 2 ETH per player (10 ETH total)

Bootcamp cost (Flights, accommodation & facility hire) - 3 ETH

Content creation expenses - 1.5 ETH

BLVKHVND operational management services - 7.5 ETH

93,Nouns Bidder POAP V2,"# Nouns Bidder POAP V2

## tl;dr
**Nounders, Nouners, and Nounish friends. ⌐◨-◨**
After an exciting V1 Bidder POAP experiment, the team is back with a proposal for a stronger, more robust, and more engaging Bidder POAP experience. With the top-tier UX talent from 0xDesigner, the unmatched creative prowess of SerNoadz, the development expertise of Plaid Shaman, and Brkfstsndwh (along with a direct line to Patricio and the POAP team), we aim to deliver a creative and engaging experience that will continue the spin wheel and proliferation of the meme to a whole new audience.

## Why
Through our V1 experiment, our team believes that having an ongoing incentive around bidding in the daily auction is not only beneficial to the DAO (promoting increased bidding on daily auctions to add capital to the treasury), but also allows more people to feel like they are a part of the DAO without actually winning the Noun on auction. POAP and team also have some fun ideas for incentives that will be coming via a secondary proposal (think, raffling off a Noun to POAP winners).

## What
- Revamped Gallery Page + Auction House and POAP Integrations
- More Advanced Claiming Mechanism
- Updated POAP Art with New Artists
- Retroactive POAPs for Winners Since V1 Ended
- 6 Months of POAPs and Management from Launch Date

## How
### Revamped Gallery Page + Integrations
- We will work with our team of designers and developers to create a revamped gallery page for showcasing the daily POAP, past POAPs, and winning bidders.
- This page will also show the live auction data for each daily auction, showcasing which bidders are currently in the running to receive one of the daily POAPs.
- Beyond that, we will integrate the POAP API more seamlessly to make the entire experience of the POAP page more engaging and informative.

### More Advanced Claiming Mechanism
- With our direct connection to the POAP team, we will work on building a more robust claiming mechanism than the direct send we conducted in V1.

### Updated POAP Art with New Artists
- Working with the incredibly talented SerNoadz, we will create a unique and updated art style for the Bidder POAPs.
- We will also aim to commission featured artists monthly that are voted on by the DAO to create unique POAP art in their own nounish style.
- Below is just an example of some of SerNoadz’s work, and is by no means the final art style. We will work with the community to land on the final and approved art style for the key POAP art.
- See example art and full prop [here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-bidder-poap-v2/1440).

### Retroactive POAPs for Winners Since V1 Ended
- Once the art is complete, we will retroactively send all POAPs to their rightful winners since V1 concluded in May at Noun 296.

94,Nouns cc0 Space Image Bank,"# Nouns cc0 Space Image Bank

# TLDR:

Space is one of the core themes in cryptoart and the NFT universe. This proposal is to ask Nouns to fund a repository of cc0 space images for all artists to use freely in their work. Sponsored by the Nouns DAO, the website will feature nounish elements as well as an ""about section"" with information about Nouns. The Nouns ecosystem will be proliferated through exposure to the artistic community as well as any potential exposure from the featuring of the space images on mainstream and specialized media. Total amount requested: 12 Eth.

# About me:
If you prefer to watch instead of reading, check out this short video I made for my SuperRare application to learn more about myself and my work. 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iffK8n9uYuJgV8BmHjQaYXPuhgGmvHxi/view?usp=sharing

My passion for space and astronomy started at a very early age and I started shooting astrophotography about 7 years ago when I first paired a camera to the eyepiece of my telescope. After doing this as a hobby for several years, two years ago I decided to quit my job in TV and film production to become a full time astrophotographer. In early 2021 I minted my first NFT and throughout this past year I've released two collections and over 20 1/1 NFTs. During this past year, my work has been featured across several media outlets such as NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day and the European Space Agency's social media profiles, as well as a number of astronomy websites and magazines, and I've even had the honor of having one of my pictures used as a stamp of the Argentine Postal Service.



# Goal:

As a way to give visibility to the Nouns DAO, a cc0 image bank of space images will be set up that will serve as a repository for artists working on space-themed art. Space is a huge theme in cryptoart and NFTs. These images will be free to be used as subjects, backdrops and to be repurposed as artists see fit without the need to attribute authorship, giving artists complete control. The url **cc0images.wtf** has already been secured to this end.

**Nouns proliferation:**

The website would be designed in line with the Nouniverse aesthetics and would contain an ""about'' section with information about Nouns. Besides strengthening ties and gaining visibility within the artist community, space images are regularly featured on specialized and mainstream media, which could potentially increase visibility to the Nouns community outside the art/NFT circles, by being featured by space agencies and more traditional media outlets reaching the general public. When published in  media, images would be credited to the photographer and the Nouns DAO.

# About the images:

As technology has pushed forward during the past years, the ability to image deep space objects like distant galaxies or nebulae has stopped being the exclusive realm of observatories and space telescopes, and amateur astronomers worldwide now have access to hardware that allows them to photograph these stunning objects. Taking hours and sometimes several nights to shoot with long exposures, these hi-res images combine complex processing skills with specialized equipment, resulting in unique artworks that capture the beauty that lies in outer space.

# Example images:

*NOTE: These are example images from my current body of work, all of the images for the image bank would be shot specifically for this project as stated in this proposal.*

# Space in Cryptoart
Some of the most well known and successful artists use space imagery in their work, here’s just a few examples from top selling artists.

All of the above are examples where the Nouns DAO could get exposure through this image bank.

In time, the repository can grow and add other categories of images for non space-related art.

# Deliverables and timeline

A website with the Nouns DAO branding with a set of 30 space images available for free download under a cc0 licence. 

Deep space images take anywhere from a couple of nights to entire weeks and require careful planning to obtain, so this is a slow rollout project. Tens of hours of exposures as well as extensive processing time are needed in order to capture these objects, and most objects only appear in the night sky during limited periods of time during the year so the collection would be slowly built throughout an entire year. Some of the images will be shot from my rooftop observatory but others require traveling to dark sky sites. The images will be a balanced mix of deep space objects shot on telescopes, solar system bodies (Sun, Moon and planets), widefield images (star fields, milky way shots, star trail images) and landscape astrophotography, to offer a wider variety of objects and backdrops for artists.

Launch of the website would be scheduled six months after proposal is approved with an initial amount of 15 images at launch, and another 15 images would be added after a second six month period (this second update could be scheduled at shorter, more frequent intervals with a smaller amount of images).

# Budget

Project management and execution, consisting of planning and acquiring the images throughout a one year period - 5 Eth

Equipment upgrades (purchases to upgrade equipment already owned) - 3 eth

Expenses for dark sky sites travel - 2 eth

Website development and maintenance (according to scope of this proposal) - 2 eth

Total: 12 Eth

# What is Art Basel?

![Art Basel](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ChubbyFantasticBallpython-size_restricted.gif)

[Art Basel](https://artbasel.com/basel), exhibiting art of the 20th and 21st centuries, is indisputably the world’s leading fair in the international art market. Around 250 selected galleries from around the world present modern and contemporary works of high quality, making the fair the most important temporary museum.
Basel is where the art world meets. Art Basel is a meeting place for artists, art collectors and many celebrities from the art scene. The high-calibre exhibitions showcase various art forms, with both works by modern masters and art by emerging talents. Art Basel brings the art world to life – which is probably why it is so successful. 
The 2019 show in Basel attracted 93,000 visitors over six days. It presented 290 galleries from 35 countries, exhibiting the work of over 4,000 artists.

96,Protect Treasury (down $43M since April),"# Protect Treasury (down $43M since April)

Since its peak in April, the treasury has gone from $78M to $35M.

People calculate their expenditures in their native currency (typically dollars) and pay people in the same.

Having some bit in USD allows us to protect against massive downside while being able to pay people in the currency they calculate and pay everyone else in.

This was proposed months ago, and ignored - while such action wouldn't have saved an immense amount of cash, a 10% hedge would have saved ~$4M (which can fund A LOT of cool nounish things).

You might think that ETH can't go any lower, but keep in mind that it went from $1400 to $70 (-95%), right now we are at (-72%) with -95% being at around a price of $250. That would leave our treasury at $6.5M. 

I'm not saying that ETH is going that low, but it's not out of the question in crypto.

To add, we can always buy the ETH back. We have so much ETH, would it hurt to hedge against the chance of an additional 80% drop?

Do the prudent thing. Protect our treasury. Convert 10% of the treasury to USDT.

I'm not adding a transaction because there are a lot of ways to skin this cat and it may best be done with a TWAP.

97,MOOØNBEANS: Nouns Baked Beans,"# MOOØNBEANS: Nouns Baked Beans

**TL;DR**

MOOØNBEANS is a project that produces and sells premium OpenSauce baked beans, and proliferates Nouns by getting them into grocery stores. This is a world first: a community-owned baked bean brand, and a true collaboration between Nouns and Sublime Butter (that’s us). To deliver on this vision, we’re asking for $150,000 (c.135 Ether).

---

**Who we are**

We’re Sublime Butter Ltd. We’re a UK-based butter company with a huge array of awards under our belt. We have excellent in-roads with distributors, a proven track record of amazing product development, and a profound understanding of brand.

[![https://i.ibb.co/949CgRH/Awards.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/949CgRH/Awards.jpg)](https://sublimebutter.com/)

But that’s not all. We have in our midst a team of powerful developers, designers, storytellers, marketers and strategists who are at the absolute top of their game. Between us we have won two Emmy awards, three Webby awards, and had two BAFTA nominations.

---

**What are the opportunities?**

1) There are a variety of legal, regulatory and licensing must-haves required to be an FMCG brand. It also takes a lot of skill, knowledge and experience to develop, produce and distribute a successful FMCG product. This makes it a tough market for a DAO to break into. UNLESS you have us as a partner. 

2) The baked bean industry in the UK is ENORMOUS. Brits get through two million tins of them every single day. And yet, it is one of the plainest and most uninventive verticals on a supermarket shelf. We think this makes it ripe for disruption.

---

**Introducing MOOØNBEANS**

Nouns-branded baked beans, developed according to Sublime’s incredible recipe. Each 400g tin will be sold for c. £2.50.

We really want to stress that this is a true collaboration, a first-of-type web3/CC0/real-world merger. Nobody has ever done anything like this before, because such a relationship has never been fostered before. It’s truly symbiotic, totally unprecedented, and paints an extremely exciting picture for the future.

Each tin will feature a Nouns character that is also represented in our marketing and on-site. We’re thinking four tin variants should be a good place to start for launch.

Nouns DAO will get **20% of all profits** from MOOØNBEANS sales. 

Moreover, getting this right (which we know we will) opens up a huge range of other opportunities in the FMCG space, and therefore a huge range of prospective revenue streams into the Nouns ecosystem. 

![https://i.ibb.co/mHg8fJr/Can-V2.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/mHg8fJr/Can-V2.jpg)

*Here’s a mock-up of some tins. Note: This is **super early,** and designed for illustrative purposes only. The actual branding, tins, website, etc. — all of which are a part of the scope of work — will be truly, abundantly Nounish.*

---

**Why we’re doing this**

- We believe in web3/CC0
- We love Nouns and everything it represents; we want to raise awareness of Nouns in an area that’s usually difficult to break into
- We want to position Sublime as a pioneering FMCG brand in the web3 space
- We believe there are a range of collaboration opportunities here, and this is an excellent test case for future disruption together
- We want to build a solid foundation for the wider MOOØNBEANS ecosystem

**Budget**

We are asking for $150k USD to take MOOØNBEANS to market (c.135 $ETH at the time of writing). Proposal costings within the model have been denominated in fiat because of the nature of FMCG engagements and their payments.

Budget Breakdown

- Brand & Product Development – $25k USD
- Website & eCom – $25k USD
- Initial MOOØNBEAN Production – $35k USD
- Initial Marketing – $65k USD
- **Total: $150k**

Profits from MOOØNBEANS will be consolidated in ETH and proportionally distributed back to a Nouns wallet address of your choosing on a monthly basis from month seven post launch.

A full model for the proposal is available as a spreadsheet on request.

**Deliverables**

In terms of our approach to delivering this project, we wanted to stress that we’ll be operating with full transparency. MOOØNBEANS will function as a distinct profit centre, and all accounts will be made public for the Nouns community to view. 

In terms of specifics, we’ll be delivering the following:

- Brand development for MOOØNBEANS
- Content strategy
- Product development
- Distribution strategy (UK first, then US by next year)
- Basic website development
- Integrated eCom functionality built into both [mooonbeans.com](https://mooonbeans.com) and [sublimebutter.com](http://sublimebutter.com) enabling the purchase of MOOØNBEANS
- Marketing plan with a heavy focus on mainstream consumer press

**Benefits to Nouns**

- Access to CPG/FMCG
- Real world revenues; first of its kind
- Major marketing and PR exposure
- Exciting new way to get people into crypto
- Future potential (e.g. other verticals)

**Timings**

**Future Phases**

If you’ve seen V1 of this proposal, you’ll know that we have a big vision for MOOØNBEANS. One that extends beyond physical products. Once we have successfully delivered on this core proposition, we have a huge range of ideas that will deepen and enhance it — with a view to stimulating mass consumer adoption, further proliferating Nouns and its derivatives, and creating other FMCG goods that will expand the Nouns x Sublime brand universe. Ideas like:

- Educational content that guides novices through their first crypto transactions/interactions
- Games, stories, and easter eggs that spotlight Nouns and other communities

**Transaction Details**

tx1: 135E to sublime.eth (proposal funding)

tx2: 0.69E to apenoun.eth (coordination & prop building)

N.b. The plan will be to convert all the ETH to USDC/stablecoin assuming proposal passes

11 Nouns will be displayed during the event in Rio and on 300+ digital billboards in Rio de Janeiro (6.7 million people) and São Paulo (12.3 million people).

This proposal is for expanding, even more, the exposure that Nouns will have during the event which will be held at Parque Lage (Rio de Janeiro).
Parque Lage is a point of reference for artistic experimentation, research and innovation.
In addition, it is an impressive century-old building in the middle of the largest urban forest in the world (image below).

This proposal is a part of the broader Nouns DAO Brazil initiative led by [B](https://twitter.com/beautyandpunk) (Noun #137) to Nounify Brazil and bring Portuguese language natives into Nouns.

Based on the success of Japan, Art Basel, Nouns in Hong Kong and NounsDAO Amigos, we propose the following:

1. Pay NFT Rio a sponsorship quota as a way of thanking the event for welcoming Nouns. (Nouns in Rio was their pinned tweet for over 1 week).
The quota will also add:
+ Nouns on their website**
+ Mention in NFT.Rio’s social media.
+ 20 minutes of Nouns 101 talk in the sponsors' room (by [Leo Clark](https://twitter.com/leoclark)).
+ Noggles image to be displayed in the institutional video (during the intervals between talks).
+ Tickets for parties (Full PDF with details available).

** As a sign of good faith Nouns have already been added to their website.

2. Photo and video crews dedicated to Nouns to document the event plus the digital billboards in Rio and São Paulo.
+ All the footage and photos are to be sent to the Marketing Studio cc0 stock.

3. Portuguese translation of Nouns.wtf (Done by [Fabio Seva](https://twitter.com/fabioseva)).

4. 1,000 A2 posters around Rio de Janeiro.
+ Like in the Hong Kong and Basel example, posters with QR code are to be spread throughout the city during the event.

5. Art contest on [NounsDAO Brazil](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOBrazil) | [NounsDAO Brasil](https://twitter.com/NounsDaoBrasil).
+ During the event, we will be reaching out to the Brazilian community and promoting a #nounish art contest with a 2 ETH prize split between 5 winners.

We will engage with the NFT community, host Twitter spaces and get them excited to work on Nouns-related art.

# WHY?

We already have great exposure as part of the exhibition alongside some of the great names in the space**. For a reasonable amount, we can thank them (and get the added bonus of being a part of the sponsors) and gain valuable media, footage/photos, as well as live Noun-pilling the audience and guests.

This will be a defining event for NFTs in Brazil.

This is a great opportunity to proliferate Nouns in Rio, also supporting the work being done with [NounsDAO Brazil](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOBrazil) | [NounsDAO Brasil](https://twitter.com/NounsDaoBrasil).

With the potential to reach millions of people and a very diverse art culture, we believe that Nounify Brazil and NounsDAO Brazil will have a great impact on inspiring and helping local communities, and at the same time bring valuable #nounish builders to Nouns.

- The goal of the project is to promote NounsDAO during Korea Blockchain Week via online and offline engagement. We hope to put content on twitter and instagram during Korea Blockchain Week.

### Date & Time: August 6-7th, 8:00 ~ 18:00
### Location: Hangang river, Seoul, South Korea

###  Description
![https://media.giphy.com/media/XAc2QIWy9ha0ihzFjO/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/XAc2QIWy9ha0ihzFjO/giphy.gif)

- J/24 sailboat is the most famous sailboat model of all time! I propose to display nouns glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of Seoul, South Korea. Seoul is home to 15+ million people and a lot of interest towards blockchain and NFTs among the population. The Korean government, businesses, and people are interested in blockchain and the NFT space. Hangang river is surrounded by two highways and will be a perfect place to reach lots of people during rush hours. The two way distance will be around 40+ kilometers. This could be a great opportunity to advertise NounsDAO and attract potential future members and developers.
- I know lots of sailors who want to participate in the Nouns Seoul PR campaign. I will create a fleet of five J/24 sailboats and sail along the river from Kimpo international airport to Itaewon bridge and back. This event is going to be organized for NounsDAO. There will be only 5 sailboats with spinnakers with Nouns Glasses logos.
- The idea is to make as many people remember Nouns-glasses. I identify two types of impressions offline and online. Images of Nouns glasses on 5 sailboat in the middle of the river will spark curiosity in the minds of the bypassers. This campaign is not a spam like poster or post that many of us learned to ignore without noticing. People would remember Nouns glasses and later when they attend a conference or buy NFTs they would recognize the Nouns symbol and would eventually come straight to the NounsDAO!
- The spinnakers are big and span an area of 8 meters in height and 4 meters in width. They definitely can be used as decoration at different events. I think the best use for sails is to give them to the teams. There are about five good regattas every year in Korea, I will provide more content free of charge when we race at different events. I am sure a pretty spinnakers with Nouns Glasses would be appreciated by the teams and used for many years.

100,Make Nouns VISIBLE FROM SPACE + Ubiquitous at the Largest Charity Beer Garden & Tailgate in the Country,"# Make Nouns VISIBLE FROM SPACE + Ubiquitous at the Largest Charity Beer Garden & Tailgate in the Country

We respectfully seek Nouns support to maintain public access to a well-established charity beer garden just steps from the largest stadium in the country (#3 in the world). In return, we offer extraordinary Nouns visibility — from the ground, the air, ***even from space***— to eight of the largest event crowds of the year. The iconic Nouns glasses will be omnipresent, allowing Nouns to make a great first impression on a vast new audience mostly unfamiliar with NFTs or DAOs. 

We will *literally* put Nouns on the map and make them part of the permanent record — the first NFT/PFP icon visible from Earth orbit — when Nouns glasses appear in updated satellite maps (Google Earth/Maps, etc.), visible to everyone at the event, near the event, or simply looking for directions near a major university and sports destination.

I founded the Cancer Support Community charity beer garden after my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. I ran it for years as an out-of-pocket labor of love. We were attracting tens of thousands of patrons each season and potential sponsors were taking notice when the pandemic shut everything down. Unable to continue funding on my own, I sold to an LLC but I retained an ownership share that allows me a chance to preserve the community event. I'm looking for an open-minded and nimble capital source to help the beer garden remain open to the public this fall while sponsors budget for FY2023. When @4156 tweeted an invitation (see below), it was clear that a DAO could be our saving grace. Relatively modest support could positively affect thousands of lives with a *MONUMENTAL* return on investment for the Nouns community.

**Benefits to Nouns**

* **MAKE NOUNS VISIBLE FROM SPACE** — massive Nouns glasses will be emblazoned on a synthetic turf installation. At 60 feet wide, they will be large enough to be visible when satellite maps are updated, meaning they'll become part of the permanent record, obvious to anyone on site *and* to anyone using Google Earth/Maps or other online navigation tools near the largest stadium in the country and a top university. Because synthetic turf doesn't require cutting and won't wear down under foot, the glasses can stay as long as it takes for the next satellite maps update. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/YA4IZkR.jpg)


* **Nouns billboard/banner** — 12-foot Nouns glasses will watch over the crowd, evident not only to the thousands of beer garden guests but unmistakable, even at a distance, to the tens of thousands walking past on game day.
![](https://i.imgur.com/M1i9gW2.png)



* **Nouns pole banners** — Nouns ubiquity continues as glasses appear in pairs on pole banners flying high above the crowd.
![](https://i.imgur.com/AtRFjN2.png)


* **Drone photos + press release** — a licensed drone photographer will capture images of the multitude of Nouns glasses *in situ* to accompany a press release describing the event and directing people to learn more about Nouns DAO.

* **TBD special event** — plans are in motion to turn the night game on September 10 into an extended affair to remember with music stage and celebrity appearances.

* **And more** — Nouns glasses and URL on event signage, pint cups, staff t-shirts, event website, press release, social media, etc.

**What does this mean for Nouns?** 

* **Proliferation** and public relations on a colossal scale: The eight-game event season will put Nouns in front of more *new eyes* than any other event. Unlike NFT-oriented gatherings where attendees are familiar with Nouns (e.g., NFT.NYC), sponsorship at the largest normie events of the year will introduce an entirely new population to the DAO in a positive and productive light — doing good for the community. There are incredible opportunities to expand Nouns brand recognition with in-person visitors immersed in Nouns iconography and countless others learning the Nouns story through media coverage of events.

* **Nounish culture**: what better way to reinforce the Nouns ethos than to support an inclusive community event and serve as ambassadors to the web3 ecosystem.

* **Diversity**: there's no other event like this. Nouns would be on the vanguard of DAO philanthropy, supporting the largest charity event of its kind. In return, Nouns would be the first NFT/PFP visible from earth orbit.

* **Successful track record**: this isn't a request to gamble on our success, it's a well-established event looking to remain publicly accessible in its post-pandemic return. Since it began in 2016, the beer garden has attracted tens of thousands of patrons each season and grossed six figures for charity.

**Who else is involved?**
Nouns DAO will join a roster of CONFIRMED partners. We're still negotiating sponsorships with a few other key players (""TBA"" below).  We've already pitched DAO membership to some of them and plan to invite the others to join us in the web3 space. Ideally, the event series will grow in subsequent seasons with support from new high-profile Nouns DAO members.

* **[Truly Hard Seltzer](https://trulyhardseltzer.com/)** — the #2 player in the hard seltzer category will expand beer garden options for thirsty patrons.
![](https://i.imgur.com/5WDruFd.png)

* **[Twisted Tea](https://www.twistedtea.com/)** — The #1 contender in the FMB sector will add even more depth to the drink lineup.
![](https://i.imgur.com/ziz2bks.png)


* **[Slows Bar BQ](https://slowsbarbq.com/)** — Detroit's finest barbecue has been featured every season since 2016 and their food truck will be back this fall with premium tailgate fare.
![](https://i.imgur.com/1KvVKdv.png)

* **[Zingerman's Creamery](https://www.zingermanscreamery.com/)** (& coffee) — the creamery arm of Zingerman's Deli, one of the best in the Midwest, will provide gelato and/or hot coffee/cocoa depending on the game day weather forecast.
![](https://i.imgur.com/jU8Qi2e.png)

* **[Hotaling & Co](https://www.hotalingandco.com/).** — their whiskey warehouse survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire long before they became a leader in super-premium artisanal spirits; they will augment the drink menu with custom cocktails, including a signature drink created for the occasion.
![](https://i.imgur.com/RYBPJNl.png)


* **[**Cancer Support Community**** — the local chapter](https://www.cancersupportannarbor.org/) of the [national](https://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/) 501(c)(3) non-profit organization is our co-host, securing the state special permit for alcohol service at the beer garden; CSC volunteers staff the event and pour drinks.
![](https://i.imgur.com/G9Q0nbv.png)

* TBA **national brand soft drink partner** — the largest distributor for the #1 soft drink brand in the US has signed on to provide non-alcoholic options. We're still lobbying for a partnership with the cola giant. Stay tuned.

* TBA **national brand beer partner** — we're in conversations with a leading national beer brand portfolio and hope to see them become a major sponsor and the next prominent beverage company to join Nouns DAO.

* TBA we're chatting with, but still have to confirm, a premium **handmade Vodka out of Austin, TX** to supplement our cocktail lineup

* We've snagged **DJ WaltAmore** (house DJ at Tin Roof, Detroit) to spin for us this season

* We've engaged the services of a sports marketing professional with experience in charitable event planning for organizations, pro athletes, and their non-profit endeavors. More info TBA.

**What does this mean to the charity? What happens if the proposal fails?**
In short, Nouns support provides a stay of execution for the *publicly accessible* event. Without sponsor support to maintain community access, the charity beer garden will not return in 2022. Instead, the site will be turned over to private and corporate interests. It's a manifestation of the conflict between web2 and web3...centralized ownership versus open access. 

A successful DAO vote means the charity event sees new life *plus* a foundation for future growth. As in the past, 100% of beer/seltzer/FMB/cocktail sales will benefit Cancer Support Community programming: education; counseling; financial assistance; healthy living (exercise, stress management, nutrition) programming; social activities for adults, teens and children; and other CSC fundraising events. Enthusiastic national brands are poised to underwrite the future of the series but, in the middle of a fiscal cycle, budget dollars have already been allocated. Nouns sponsorship this fall would provide a bridge to next season when beverage and other brand sponsors can earmark funds for their participation.

In sports entertainment marketing circles, this location is a unicorn. Of roughly two dozen properties covered by a city council resolution granting broad game day allowances to specific properties in the stadium vicinity, it's the only available vacant parcel this large. Sponsorship value has been estimated by sports marketing agencies at $12-18/sqft per game based on site characteristics, recent team performance, and media coverage that accompanies the nationally televised events around which the beer garden is scheduled.

* Proximity to venue — 285 yards to stadium gate
* Generous open space — over 10,000 square feet
* Privately owned — no municipal or university red tape
* Existing municipal approvals for game day sales and commercial display
* No neighbors to complain — no residential units within 400 feet

Having a respected and successful history here, the charity event has a right of first refusal to remain...but only if we can secure a sponsor. If we continue, the beer garden will offer the closest alcohol sales to the largest football crowd in the country at a stadium that doesn't serve beer (and the nearest bar a mile away). 

**What is the ask?**
The benefits to the community are beyond measure but the cost is easy to quantify — roughly the equivalent of two freshly minted Nouns. Let's check the math: the average price of a new Noun over the past 30 days is just under 110 ETH. Assuming/hoping ETH doesn't fall below $1050 before we can successfully float this proposal, two Nouns would total $220,500 — just under the minimum needed to keep the event in public hands (see cost breakdown below). 

At the YTD average mint price (a conservative 80 ETH per Noun) the DAO treasury will increase by almost 6,000 ETH before the event series starts in September. We respectfully request 225.15 ETH, a little over twice the daily mint price, to preserve the community charity event. 

**Why are we asking Nouns for help?**
It's been asked, ""why should Nouns sponsor this particular event?"" There is no inherent link between Nouns and a college football beer garden but there are extraordinary benefits for both parties. A year after meeting @4156, his tweet on Feb. 17 was a welcome invitation to engage an open-minded and responsive community. “**Shill us your crazy ideas**,” he said, “**we will fund them!**” If I couldn't send a Nouns to space but I could make Nouns visible FROM space. The Nounish ethos of bootstrapped identity and community is embodied in what we've achieved and hope to continue. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/M75Hg6R.png)



**Where will the money go?**
Before the current bearish dip, 225 ETH would have been enough to ensure a long and healthy future for the beer garden. It's still enough to fund the bare-bones improvements to benefit Nouns and the event series. If funded, we'd convert crypto to fiat immediately to cover the synthetic turf installation. The Nouns flags and banners described above would be out-of-pocket-expenses. The list below includes improvements that will follow as additional funding allows (calculated at $1050/ETH).

* **224 ETH: Synthetic turf installation INCLUDING 60-FOOT NOUNS GLASSES** — we've been quoted a 1.5-inch finished pile that uses an environmentally friendly backing and infill with realistic color and exceptional durability and drainage. Turf materials, excavation and installation run $14/sqft for 11,000 feet of coverage. Ultrabase underlayment panels ($6/sqft) will go in between the compacted gravel base and the turf/infill to handle large vehicle traffic (food trucks, beer trailers, buses, dumpster service, portajohn maintenance). Infill and perimeter board add $15,000 to bring the total cost to $235,000.

* **0.4 ETH: Nouns Glasses Billboard/Banner** — One 6x12' heavy-duty vinyl outdoor banner with grommets and heat-welded hems 

* **0.75 ETH Nouns Pole Banners** — Four double-sided 2x5' pole banners and hangers, to install in pairs on two utility poles on site

**Is that the end of it? What comes next?**
Two Nouns (225 ETH) allows the charity event to last another year, allowing time to negotiate future sponsorship. If this proposal succeeds and Nouns feedback is positive, we may draft a follow-up proposal to name Nouns as the lead sponsor of the event. It wouldn't take much to get there...maybe the equivalent of a third Noun:

* **72 ETH: Fifty 10-foot Polysteel Picnic Tables** — community seating for up to 500 people at once (excl. shipping or assembly)

* **25 ETH: One 40x100' frame tent with water ballast tanks** — it's less expensive to purchase than to rent for the eight events in a single charity season (excl. dis/assembly & storage cost)


**About me, the location, and the charity:**
I spent more than two decades as a professional photographer, winning two Emmy Awards and a pair of national POY honors before moving into software where I helped commercial and educational clients manage and monetize digital assets. I started my own business but continue to pursue this labor of love. I avoid the spotlight so there are more mentions of the charity organization than of me in Google search results. I bought the property in 2007 and hosted the community event free of charge until I was unable to sustain my out-of-pocket support and gave up control to an LLC. I remain a member so I have the opportunity to seek sponsorship for the charity event before the LLC turns the property over to private interests.

Why wait so long to say *WHERE* this event takes place? Because sports fans have passionate feelings about which teams they do and don't support. The largest stadium in the country, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is home to a team that engenders strong feelings, for *and* against.  I didn't want non-fans to react to the team before understanding the benefits.

The cause that we support is the [local chapter](https://www.cancersupportannarbor.org/) of the national 501( c)(3) non-profit [Cancer Support Community](https://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/). One hundred per cent of beer sales go to the CSC to support education; counseling; financial assistance; healthy living (exercise, stress management, nutrition) programming; social activities for adults, teens and children; and other CSC fundraising events. The CSC is supportive of my Nouns outreach and the Director addressed a letter of support to any potential sponsors.

## Who We Are

We are a community of Nounish builders setting out to create a Daily Celebration of Noun O’ Clock called The Noun Square, administered by a Nouncil-like body and with the goal of proliferating Nouns by turning Noun O’ Clock into a “Shared Moment” for the entire Internet. We have successfully completed two week pilot using a combination of Small Grants and out-of-pocket funds for prizes (data from which which has informed this proposal)   

## Our vision

For anyone who grew up in the 70s, 80s or 90s, “The Price is Right” holds a special place in our collective psyche. For over 50 years, its daily blend of ritual and play has entertained hundreds of thousands of people the world over.  We believe Noun O’ Clock can recreate this kind of shared experience for web3.

**Broad Goals:**

- **Turn NOC into a daily shared global moment** - develop a grass-root, organic, daily show that introduces more people to  nouns & its thriving community & sub-communities. As well as creates a space in which our growing community can meet daily and share a live moment together.


- **Model our community on Nouncil** - a collective of builders all over the globe with varied skillsets, collaborating to organize and administer a daily Twitter Spaces. We think that a decentralized community model can be the nounish way to scale a Noun O' Clock show! 

- **Be consistent (”one NOC, every day, forever”)** - Even in the deep NOC winter, we believe consistency is key to cementing NOC as a daily celebration for the Internet. We are planning ahead for this with hosts from all over the world.


## The (Current) Format

- Begin 15 min before NOC every day.
- Contest review & announcements.
- Casual guest interview while watching/discussing end of daily Noun auction.
- Play FOMO Live together (we invite as many attendees as possible to come on stage and keep mics open for an interactive experience.)
- Give live Secret Word for those who wish to collect POAP for attendance.

*On weekends, we run a LITE version of The Noun Square featring only FOMO live, hosted by a different nounish community every Saturday (e.g. Lil Nouns and GOOP DAO the past two weeks, future guest hosts Nouns DAO Japan, Korean Noun Fans, NounPunks, FloriNouns, etc.)

## The Team: 3 C's

**Core Team (Responsible for Execution):**
- Toady Hawk
- Noun 142
- Ser Noadz

**Council (Responsible for Decisions and Daily Direction)**

- SuperTightWoody
- Goldy
- Joshua Fisher
- Maty
- Benbodhi
- !Xargs
- Sam Ellis
- Aubtoshi
- RyanMac21

**Community (Talent Funnel for Council)**
- Growing Discord Community

## Growing the community

- We want to grow the community and **build in the open.** We have created a Discord server [open to anyone who wants to contribute.](https://discord.gg/qsUk2v4ZB3) We have also created a public Google Sheet that tracks our progress and metrics and future plans for [anyone to follow along](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zmEFFLxUszyKZzo8CJP6KlXC581NkPLtek4GN6h7T8/edit?usp=sharing).
- Hosting a live Spaces every day is an audacious goal (albeit one we are excited about), and will require participation and help from Nounsfolk in all timezones, especially as NOC drifts into the North American Night.

## Compensation Model

Our ask for the next 30 days is 55 ETH:

- **Contest rewards (0.5 eth/day * 20 weekdays = 10 ETH)**
    - We will experiment with these numbers and the cadence of them as we move forward, but so far this amount and cadence has produced excellent participation.

- **Team reward + operations (see budget below): 45 ETH**
    - Because we intend to build this initiative as a community effort, we will be modeling our team reward, at least for the first period, on Nouncil’s proven model of a Coordinape round, where all active participants will allocate tokens based on contributions.** We think this will ultimately be a fairer and more frictionless way of properly rewarding the team than attempting to itemize every hour of effort, etc.

    - Based on our pilot, we  estimated how many man-hours it takes to run a show like this every day. We think these are reasonable overall estimates.

### The Contests

Inspired by 4156 ad-hoc contests a few weeks back, we have run 10 contests with really great engagement and wonderful creativity from noun lovers on twitter:

### Gamifying NOC with POAPs

We are using POAPs to gamify NOC and create both engagement and loyalty. We feel that our use of Daily Attendance POAPs is the purest use case for the tech (literally “Proof of Attendance”) and we want to use them to incentivize people to attend Noun O’ Clock every single day if they can. 

So far, it’s working! Ser Noadz has been creating amazing daily animated POAPs based on the new Noun of the Day and would continue to do so for the first month (after which we would explore other “Series” by other Nounish artists.) 

![IMG-2420.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/brHXK5FS/IMG-2420.jpg)

We also want to experiment with doing bonuses like physical Merch drops for those with provable streaks of attendance, and raffles that are easier to win the more times you have attended. 

Example Possible “The Noun Square” Merch Drop for Attendance Streaks:

## Playing FOMO

The peak moment of The Noun Square is, of course, playing FOMO live and minting a new Noun together. When FOMO starts during the Twitter Space, we ask all speakers to unmute and speak their mind, to create as much chaos, interaction and fun as possible. The feedback so far has been that people have been loving it!  

We have noticed anecdotally that FOMO seems to take longer on average with more players, until we hit that beautiful noun that reaches some consensus. We think the Nouns minted over the past week or so are especially legendary, and believe it’s related to our efforts to gamify FOMO and bring in new players.

The impressive roster of Nouns minted by FOMO since we started:

## Our plan for the next 30 days

- **Host a Noun o’ Clock every. single. day.**
- **Make it fun & intereting:** Run a contests, and have guests for every weekday
- **Be inclusive:** Invite a different nounish extension, subdao or community to host every weekend.
- **Grow the NOC community:** Invite as many interested Nounsfolk to join our Discord and share ideas, volunteer to help where they can.
- **Curate an Organizational Committee**: will handles all the day to day tasks to keep this going in a decentralized manner.
- **Run a Coordinape round:** At the end of each 15 day period, reward contributors by Coordinape Round.

**Grow our reach:**
- **500k Tweet impressions** on our @noun_o_clock Twitter account.
- **1000+ Twitter following** 
- Grow daily show attendance to 125 per day, and average FOMO Players to 85+.
- Produce over 800 unique pieces of Nounish content in the form of public entries to our Noun O’ Clock contests. 
- Teach hundreds of new people about Nouns and Noun o’ Clock through our informative and entertaining spaces.

**Potential challenges**

1. July gets into very late night EST and we may have fewer participants. However, we believe that consistency is key, as well as the opportunity to get more people from non-north america timezones to hear about nouns.
2. Over-saturation is a risk of course, as with anything that happens daily. But as with The Price is Right, we hope to create a shared ritual with the community we are building, such that the daily show is something they look forward to, rather than a chore they get bored of. We are building variety into the structure of the show, with a mixture of weekly segments and novel guests and contests to keep things interesting for many, many months (and hopefully longer!) 

**In Conclusion:**

Over the past two weeks, we have kicked off a tradition of making Noun O’ Clock a daily celebration, featuring live Twitter Spaces, interactive contests and special guests. So far, people love it. (See feedback section below)

We believe that, if given funding to execute our vision detailed here, we can bring new attention to Nouns and the daily auction every day, while also supporting extension and sub-DAO communities, and engaging active Nounish builders. 

**Let’s work together to make Noun O’ Clock into a shared moment for the Internet!**

**Feedback from attendees has been great:**

> “The Noun Square gives a much needed voice to what is Nounish. A platform to congregate daily, learn and vibe, uniting Nounsfolk, and beyond, around the world!” *-Metamonk*
> 

> “I don’t watch TV anymore, but I do miss the days when I would spend my evenings with David Letterman on the Late Show. It was home to me. And that is what the Noun O’ Clock team are doing right now. **It definitely feels like home to me.** ” *-Leo Clark*
> 

> “This event is now something that I want to do every single day.  I am literally trying to figure out how to turn over my entire family's sleep schedule! Getting to hear my Nounish frens and what they are up to is amazing. **This event has also proven to be a wonderful way for me to onboard new folks into Nouns.** I leave this every day with dozens of new and Nounish ideas, and feeling great and motivated.” *-!xargs*
> 

> “**Having a common and consistent place to gather for a Noun O’ Clock event is something folks need**--a kind of programming schedule that they can tap into every day. The engagement events have been fun and accessible and rotating guests have been a good way to introduce folks to extension projects while celebrating the nouns in general! The POAPS are great and give a feeling of being part of the history of the noun minted that day..” *-Sam Ellis*
> 

> “For a couple months, I’ve tried to touch base in the Discord during FOMO as a fun way to interact with those in the Nouns eco system. **Having this extended virtual event via Spaces has taken that to a whole new level!** The Spaces, the guests (David Horvath!), the games, the prizes and the POAPs all bring different aspects of interaction, energy and motivation to attend.  Unlike 20 years ago, we rarely have shared cultural experiences as a society anymore (think TV show series finales etc.) **We have an opportunity to create one here that is open to everyone to enjoy on a global scale.** How exciting!” *- Prof Werder*

### Title
NounsDAO in Korea, Sailing PR campaign

### tl;dr
Organize sailing regatta and display Nouns Glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of Seoul, South Korea.

![https://media.giphy.com/media/XAc2QIWy9ha0ihzFjO/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/XAc2QIWy9ha0ihzFjO/giphy.gif)

### Summary
- Sail 40 km on five J/24 sailboats with huge Nouns-themed sails.
- Location: Hangang river, Seoul, South Korea (population 15 million)
- The river is surrounded by two 20+ km highway roads, cycling roads, parks, and high-rise buildings. There are 13 bridges for cars, subways, trains, and pedestrians.

### Objective
- Promote NounsDAO via online and offline engagement.
- Get local media coverage (Invite newspaper and TV journalists)

### Location: Hangang river, Seoul, South Korea
### Date & Time: September 17-18th, 8:00 ~ 18:00
- September 17th: Kimpo Airport→Gangnam
- September 18th: Gangnam→Kimpo Airport
*(The exact date and time might be changed in case of logistics delays or bad weather)*

###  Description
- J/24 sailboat is the most famous sailboat model of all time! I propose to display nouns glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of Seoul, South Korea. Seoul is home to 15+ million people and a lot of interest in blockchain and NFTs among the population. The Korean government, businesses, and people are interested in blockchain and the NFT space. Hangang river is surrounded by two highways and will be a perfect place to reach many people during rush hours. The two-way distance will be around 40+ kilometers. This could be a great opportunity to advertise NounsDAO and attract potential future members and developers.
- I know lots of sailors who want to participate in the Nouns Seoul PR campaign. I will create a fleet of five J/24 sailboats and sail along the river from Kimpo international airport to Itaewon bridge and back. This event is going to be organized for NounsDAO. There will be only 5 sailboats with spinnakers with painted Nouns Glasses logos.
- The idea is to make as many people remember Nouns-glasses. Images of Nouns glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of the river will spark curiosity in the minds of the bypassers. This campaign is not a spam-like poster or post that many of us learned to ignore without noticing. People would remember Nouns glasses and later when they attend a conference or buy NFTs they would recognize the Nouns symbol and would eventually come straight to the NounsDAO!
- The spinnakers are big and span an area of 8 meters in height and 4 meters in width. After the regatta, I think the best use for sails is to give them to the sailing teams. There are about five good regattas every year in Korea, I will provide more content free of charge when we race at different events with the Nouns-themed sails. I am sure pretty spinnakers with Nouns Glasses would be appreciated by the teams and be used for many years!

### Spinnaker sail designs
I have connections to Hyde sails dealership and can place an expedited order for 5 spinnaker sails with printed logo of the nouns glasses. The Nouns glasses will be permanently spray-painted at the sail makers factory.

103,Fund Nouns Clients Development,"# Fund Nouns Clients Development 

**tl;dr:**
> Requesting 100 ETH to fund 4 teams 25 ETH each via a a nouner voted Prop House Round to fund Nouns Client development.


## Idea
Developing multiple clients to interact with the Nouns protocol is desirable for various reasons:
- Unexplored design space
- Removes single point of failure
- Decreases reliance on any one vendor, platform and/or technology

Possible directions teams have expressed in taking development:
- Bidder focused: client where the only focus is the bidder's experience. 
- Audience focused: client where the priority are those who are watching the auction (read: social) 
- Post-auction focus: build FOMO on steroids.

## Execution
Teams have already [expressed interest via twitter](https://twitter.com/cryptoseneca/status/1541457754732249090). Conversation around how this evolves is ongoing in the #nouns-clients channel.  The format as it stands today (07/01) is as follows:
- Fund 4 teams @ 25 ETH via a Prop House Round (nouner vote)
- Regroup 1 month after funding to see progress the teams have made
- Either host a bigger round or ask team to directly propose to the DAO for more funding

104,Free Glasses For Kids v4,"# Free Glasses For Kids v4

By Jawshua Fisher & Fitz Frames

tl;dr:
After completing a succesful pilot we can expand the Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription to 3,000 Kids for $300,000

In addition we can pilot a Nounish Vision Van Program with Sergul Ezurum, MD, founder of Sight For All United who will spearhead this initiative in parternship with Vision To Learn. Together we will create a high tech, Nounish Vision Van Program and execute a years worth of exams covering 3-4,000 kids for $250,000

*there might be some overlap between NxFF Subscription Prescriptions and Sight For All United's program but they are not inclusive of each other.

Recap: Prop 12: Nouns x Fitz Frames Free Glasses For Kids v2:
[Nouns x Fitz Free Glasses For Kids v2](https://nouns.wtf/vote/12) was a huge success. We were able to visit 3 schools, complete 355 eye exams and dispense subscriptions for 285 kids in need, delivering a total of 391 custom fitted 3D printed Fitz Frames glasses to date.

We spent a significant effort developing Noun Frames which inspired other builders and led the way for FUN Frames and Fashion Frames to move into development.

Nouns x Fitz Frames FGFK v4:
We want to do this again, but this time let’s do more!

Continuing our partnership with Fitz Frames & partnering with various vision screening and testing providers we will deliver 3,000 Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscriptions.

The Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription, which provides free glasses for kids if they lose them, break them, grow out of them or just desires a new pair because their style changed, will be expanded to 3K kids. Using a propriatery in-app measurement and delivery system Fitz Frames removes the need for in-person fittings and shapings that require specialized equipment and gets the perfect custom fit 3D printed glasses for kids individual face shape and personal style. Our goal is to keep kids in glasses that fit and they're proud to wear, even as they change throughout the year.

Expanding the scale of this program will get us one step closer to our moon shot of creating a system where individual doctors around the world can plug in to and get free glasses for kids in need through the Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription program.

As a pivot from a Nationwide Sponsorship for Vision To Learn we have the opportunity to work hand in hand with Sight For All United on launching a new Vision Van Program complete with a brand new van that we can collaborate together on to make it as Nounish as possible. This will allow us to peek under the hood, literally, at how Vision To Learn works and the impact these programs deliver to communities where they are available.

Nouns X Fitz Prescription Subscription - $300,000
Nounish Vision Van - $250,000

PHASES OF EXECUTION
PHASE 1:
150K - Fitz Frames
150K - Nounish Vision Van Program / Sergul

PHASE 2: Fund second 50% of proposed allocation
150K - After delivery of 1K Prescription Subscriptions
100K - Nounish Vision Van Program - Paid upon delivery of the Van

Send $575K (~550ETH) equivalent of ETH to Fitz Frames Gnosis from v2. Added some cushion for volatility during prop window. Will work with Seneca to convert and then pay front end and send ETH balance back to the DAO. Will pay backend upon reaching benchmarks.

Gnosis Address: 0xC7C696c74490b1ae1b705d7A2a6058B5591DE641

Additional Opportunities
Press Opportunites
Between testing, fullfillment and event there are many opportunities for great press.
Fitz Frames our screening partners have great press contacts that we can talk with.

Branding on Fitz Frame Glasses
For the Nouns X Fitz Frams Prescription Subscription glasses we can include Nouns logo on the temples or even a Noun itself.
Could possibly upgrade to letting kids pick the noun they want.

Nounish Vision Van - Branding on Mobile Vision Clinic
We can work hand in hand on creating a wonderful Nounish Vision Van with Sight For All United.

Nounish Gift Packs for Kids
Nouns Gift Packs that can include mutually approved items such as FUN Frames, stickers, coloring books, keychain, and more.
Bigshot Toy Works has commmitted to helping find the right package and offered fullfillment. Will deterimine on a case by case basis which partners can deliver which items.



FOR REFERENCE: Prop 12
NounsDAO Grant Proposal

By Joshua Fisher & Fitz Frames
tl;dr
In celebration of the fact that every Noun is a glasses wearer, Fitz Frames would like to propose a perpetual funding allocation to deliver prescription eyeglasses to children in need.

Fitz Frames in partnership with Vision to Learn (as well as additional outreach partners) can deliver a no-cost eye exam plus an annual membership to Fitz Frames for children in need. A Fitz Frames membership includes two complete pairs of prescription eyeglasses with unlimited replacement frames should they lose, break, grow out of the glasses, or their prescription changes.

In addition to their Fitz Frames Membership each child will receive an additional free pair of Noun Frames, glasses that mimic the pair worn by their favorite Noun.

As an initial pilot program, we propose Nouns DAO allocate 9ETH (~$30,000 worth of ETH) to provide glasses to approximately 300 kids (aprox $100) per child. This will be done with in conjunction with our outreach partner Vision to Learn in an initial focus geography (probably Ohio and/or Detroit). Progress reports will be given to NounsDAO on an ongoing basis, but no less than once a quarter. The pilot program is expected to run approximately 90 days, but children will continue to receive replacement glasses for the full year as needed. The purpose of the pilot program is to validate and refine the offering and delivery process, with the goal of expanding the efforts nationwide and eventually internationally.

At the end of the initial pilot program, Fitz present the results of the program and will put to a vote either a continuation, expansion, or termination of the program.

Additionally, we request 2ETH in one-time funding to build outreach materials (print, animation, and website) directed towards schools to explain the program, Nouns, Fitz, and the underlying technology of blockchain, NFTs, and additive manufacturing.

Proposal
Fitz would like to eventually build to a perpetual funding mechanism in order to expand our existing social good efforts and deliver eyewear on an ongoing basis to kids in need. In the interim, we’d like to propose a pilot program to prove out the model and refine delivery mechanism:

$30K allocation from Nouns treasury to provide approximately 300 no-cost vision tests plus Fitz Frames memberships to kids in need, initially in a limited geographical focus area.

Fitz will provide annual memberships at cost of $100)/kid/year discounted from $185. Annual Membership consists of two pairs of custom fit glasses plus unliminted replacements.

Fitz will provide an additional free pair of Noun Frames, mimicking their favorite Nouns, limited to an initial selection of 10 Noun options for the Pilot Program.

Vision to Learn, will identify recipients and provide no-cost eye exams within the geographical focus area. Initial prospects are Ohio and Detroit.

Initial Pilot Program is expected to run approximately 90 days, at which point Fitz will present a report of progress to the NounsDAO.
At that point the NounsDAO can vote to expand, continue, or suspend the pilot program.

Based on findings from the initial Pilot Program, elements can be refined including: delivery mechanism, offering, and outreach. Additionally, Fitz Frames will work to try and secure additional underwriting in order to extend the reach of the program. (possibly through Medicaid reimbursement, or local philanthropic partners)

In order to promote the program (and help surface Nouns to a wider public awareness) we propose dedicating an additional 2ETH to develop outreach materials including print, short form animation, and a dedicated website. This will target schools, the student recipients of glasses, and broader public. In addition to promotion of the program, this is an opportunity to introduce the technology elements underpinning both Nouns and Fitz Frames, and develop age-appropriate STEM curriculum for the kids who receive the glasses.

Nouns is a fantastic example of people leveraging technology to come together and build long-term value in perpetuity. Fitz leverages the power of technology to change the lives of kids. We think this is a natural partnership that would not only do a tremendous amount of good, but could serve as tangible application of blockchain doing tangible good. At Fitz, we believe that those who can see the world are the ones who can change the world. NounsDAO embodies this ethos completely, and we couldn’t imagine a better partner.

Noun Frames
Fitz will integrate Nouns Frames into their application so that users can pick their favorite Noun and receive glasses that mimic those frames as well as have the Noun itself printed on the side of the frames as well as the Noun number printed on the inside.

105,Prop House Protocol: Public Infrastructure by Nouns DAO,"# Prop House Protocol: Public Infrastructure by Nouns DAO

## Description:

What started as an experimental approach for Nouns DAO to deploy capital has become core infrastructure to onboard and fund builders within the Nouns ecosystem. Consequently, the idea has been spreading. From [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/pg-wg-proposal-ens-small-grants/12843), to [Ape Coin](https://twitter.com/mg/status/1532551973127561223?s=20&t=Bi66tsHPt1j7tbYBvQ9iPA) to [AAVE](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1536867802501500928), communities across the broader crypto space have expressed interest in using Prop House.

I propose building the Prop House Protocol as public infrastructure with the aims of it being a tool for all to use while proliferating the Nouns meme at the deepest level.

## Where we are today:

### Summary:

- 300+ proposals submitted
- 2,000+ votes allocated
- 5 active houses
- 157 ETH committed to 52 builders across 10 funding rounds
- [prop.house](https://prop.house) UX continues to improve
- External interest:
  - [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/pg-wg-proposal-ens-small-grants/12843) building their own version of Prop House
  - [Ape coin](https://twitter.com/mg/status/1532551973127561223?s=20&t=Bi66tsHPt1j7tbYBvQ9iPA) and [Aave](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1536867802501500928) are amongst the 10+ communities that have expressed interest in setting up their own house
- Please review the [Expenses report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iKGgedZmAzMNCFkd2PqjBd-ZgutrOjuYqfirDG1wS3g/) for an overview of all things Prop House financials

### Proposals:

At the time of writing (06/18), 18 proposals have had enough time elapse since being funded to make a judgement on whether or not they executed. So far, only 1 out of 18 proposals has had a no-show. Overall, quality of proposals corresponding to amounts funded are still desirable. With the launch of Nouns Combinator (25 ETH single winner house), we hope to see more ambitious proposals be submitted.

### Houses:

We are currently running 4 nounish houses with another two coming online soon:

> To view all the proposals that have been funded so far, please visit [prop.house](https://prop.house)

Two experiments were run with external houses:

- Zorbs failed due to the round being endlessly spammed. Beyond the spam, there was a clear misconception in what Prop House was to be used for, hinting at more education content being needed.
- [Mfers house](https://prop.house/mfers) has been quite a success. The [announcement tweet](https://twitter.com/nounsprophouse/status/1534967734181711880) rallied the community and the subsequent reaction points to Nouns earning goodwill as a leader in the CC0 community.

## The Protocol

The protocol refers to the suite of smart contracts and open-source software that would enable anyone to run their own auctions and/or Prop House web app.

### Why build the protocol in the first place?

Currently, Prop House runs as a centralized system. Each round and all of its parameters are decided on by a few people. More importantly, the Prop House multi-sig handles all the funding. As volumes grow, it increasingly becomes a risk factor.

Building Prop House into a protocol would enable the DAO to have more control over how the capital is deployed. To illustrate, the following scenario would be possible with a live protocol:

- An on-chain proposal to the DAO to set up 10 rounds at x ETH for y winners over the next 3 months

### Why build it as public infrastructure?

Beyond proliferating the Nouns aesthetic, I believe building public infrastructure proliferates the meme at a much deeper level hence it being the way forward.

[Nouns is uniquely positioned to capture value via novel means](https://twitter.com/hongkim__/status/1533161235025260544). One of the drivers for auction demand is how aspirational the meme is. Akin to luxury goods, demand is in large part driven by psychology, not just ad spend or certain KPIs. It then follows that building public infrastructure that sets Nouns as the most forward-thinking community also contributes to auction demand.

Much more than a brand or a visual meme, Nouns is an invitation for others to join us in taking the new tools we now have at hand to rethink how we build the world around us. To that extent, public infrastructure for all is the Nounish thing to do.

### To continue exploring:

Along with building the protocol, we are looking forward to:

- Experimenting with bigger rounds
- Integrating with [Snapshot](https://docs.snapshot.org/)
- Exploring new auction formats
  - Infinite auctions
  - Retroactive rewards
  - Pod and mandate specific houses
- New nounish houses (Nouns DAO Japan, SharkDAO are coming soon)
- Updates around the UI (past winners, voting data, etc)
- Helping other communities onboard

## Budgets

### Past:

Total funded by the DAO since Dec ’21 through via proposals [23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23) & [62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62): - 95 ETH paying Prop House contributors (~50% still remains for Jul & Aug) - 150 ETH in funding Prop House builders

### Current Ask:

**Operations (600 ETH):**

- 100 ETH: Adds two solidity developers to payroll for remaining 2 months (July and August)
- 440 ETH: Extends Prop House development runway by 4 months (Sept - Dec)
  - Team on payroll consists of 2 solidity devs, 1 backend, 1 frontend and 1 designer (solimander, vapeape, devcarrot, seneca, toastee)
- 60 ETH: Misc expenses
  - Smart contract audits
  - Helping Nounish communtiies get set up (e.g. Nouns DAO Japan was ~10 ETH)
  - Operations (infura, linear figma, etc)

**Funding Builders (400 ETH):**

- Capital to deploy through funding auctions. We're currently at a ~80 ETH / month rate. 400 ETH would allow for 5 months of funding across all nounish houses.

**TOTAL ASK: 1000 ETH (600 PH contributors, 400 for funding builders)**

With this grant, **the funds received for one year (Dec '21 - Dec '22) of Prop House discovery and development** over the three proposals would total:

- 710 ETH for funding development
- 550 ETH for funding prop builders.

## Deliverables

- Suite of smart contracts that allow anyone to fund and deploy their own funding auctions
- Open-source front-end for anyone to fork and run their own web app
- Documentation to help developers and communities alike get started

## Sustainability

We are exploring ways to make Prop House sustainable such that no future ask is required from Nouns DAO. While we are still open to any paths forward, one that seems plausible is creating Prop House DAO where Nouns DAO has meaningful ownership of the newly formed DAO. This would allow Nouns DAO to continue to capture any upside that comes from Prop House while aligning incentives accordingly.

## Background

Verbs term consists of two Solidity/full-stack engineers (Elad and David) who executed Proposal 4 and are on the tail end of a 3 month engagement with the Tech Pod (Proposal 54). In the last ~2 (of 3) months engagement the team has conducted R&D, implemented, and tested significant improvements to the Nouns protocol such as dynamic quorum (https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/438) and descriptor v2 (https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/499).

Based on the success of this trial engagement, the Tech Pod and Verbs teams want to re-engage on a 6 month contract with updated terms.

## Contract Terms

- 6 month engagement starting August 1.
- Either party can cancel with 1 month advanced notice.
- Nominal $37.5k per person (2) per month (6) paid in USDC or ETH.
- 3 ETH per month for Tech Pod member Solimander for time spent managing roadmap, meetings, code reviews, and rollout.

## Compensation

- Verbs compensation: 472.5 ETH
    - 5% volatility buffer included
    - To be converted to USDC upon receipt
- Additional for Tech Pod member: 18 ETH

107,NounsDAO investment in Verse,"# NounsDAO investment in Verse

### TLDR

This proposal is for a NounsDAO investment in Verse, a new protocol for autonomous NFTs on Ethereum.

### Who is behind this proposal?

hey everyone! My name’s Kiran. I’m the founder of Verse, an autonomous NFT protocol on Ethereum. Previously, I worked on product design for PartyDAO, and in my web2 life I was a product engineer in the biotech space.

### What is Verse?

Verse is a protocol for autonomous NFTs on Ethereum. What does that mean? Verse enables the creation of NFTs with an embedded market that operates autonomously without the need for a central marketplace. Here’s a quick overview of how the protocol mechanism works:

Through the protocol, a creator deploys a contract Pair consisting of an ERC-20 Exchange contract and an ERC-721 Hyperobject contract. The dynamic price and supply of the ERC-20 token is managed by a bonding curve acting as an AMM. Simply, this means that anyone can buy and sell the token at any time with instant liquidity, and the contract will programmatically adjust the price based on the circulating supply. Holders of at least 1 atomic unit of the ERC-20 token can then redeem their token. Redeeming a token transfers the holder’s ERC-20 to the paired Hyperobject contract, which mints a new NFT and transfers it to the redeemer in exchange.

### What is the status of Verse?

The contracts for Verse V1 are live on mainnet, and the public beta interface to interact with the protocol is live at verse.xyz. Verse V2 is currently in development, with significant UX improvements and nounish mechanisms built into the core protocol.

### What can be built on Verse?

The Verse protocol represents a new medium for NFTs, and enables the creation of digital objects that have their own embedded market. Although the NFT space is still in its early infancy, we can observe some fundamental truths about the medium. Most notably, NFTs aren’t just assets or static files or jpegs. NFTs are programmable objects built to take advantage of the internet as a meme proliferation machine. In the long-term, skeuomorphic token representations like 1/1s will diminish in the market, and NFTs with programmable supply & pricing mechanisms will dominate. A significant sector of the NFT market will be represented by these types of objects, and are best suited to be exchanged via programmable markets powered by Verse. Think about it [this way](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1530697363714605056?s=20&t=-FFqbcGhiso88p_ZAhgOlg). Does it really make sense for a meme to exist as a static 1/1? Or does it make sense for its supply and value to dynamically change based on its demand in the market and its mindshare on the internet?

### NounsDAO investment in the Verse Protocol

Verse is a new NFT protocol designed to catalyze the future development of programmable internet objects. Nouns is the prototype for meme proliferation and how to build a CC0 brand that permeates the internet. Ultimately, both entities are designed to build a more composable internet in which individuals build, own, and use digital objects that accrue value as they’re integrated across the web.

Specifically, Verse V2 is incorporating mechanisms into the core protocol which seek to standardize the meme-proliferation system (programmable supply, programmable treasury controlled by NFT holders) that Nouns has pioneered. Details of the exact mechanisms will be shared closer to V2’s testnet launch.

We’re closing a funding round for Verse, and firmly believe that the protocol shouldn’t only be owned by traditional venture or finance institutions - it should have ownership from decentralized groups actively advancing and building progressive technologies in the NFT ecosystem.

Thus, we’d like to propose an investment from NounsDAO in the Verse protocol.
We think that an investment/long-term partnership would be far more powerful than a grant in that an investment incentivizes both parties (NounsDAO & Verse) to ensure that the protocol builds for long-term success, and uses the Nouns brand as a playground for innovating on new NFT mechanisms.

There’s tremendous synergy between the goals of Nouns and Verse, and a long-term partnership would entail close collaborations to build future Nouns-related NFT projects on Verse, and the ability for the DAO to have a real hand in how the protocol evolves over time.

### Investment Specifics
NounsDAO invests 175 ETH in exchange for 0.4-0.5% equity into Verse Labs (the incorporated company building the Verse protocol) with an optional token warrant. These equity figures are consistent with the current terms we have with our lead investors for our most recent funding round.

A portion of the funding would go directly toward purchasing a Noun, either via the daily auction (preferred), or purchasing from an existing Nouner on secondary. I want to align the interests of Nouns x Verse as long-term as possible, and believe that by essentially exchanging ownership in the Verse protocol for representation in NounsDAO, we’d create a truly symbiotic relationship. I like to think that Nouns is building the closest thing we’ve seen to an internet city, with a distinct community, culture, and economy. Much like the way tech companies in the past decade set up shop in the bay area and saw the valley as a playground for innovation, I want Verse to have a “campus” set up in the Nouns universe, and build with the Nouns brand as a launchpad for new types of NFT distribution & exchange experiments that help proliferate the meme. The key difference, though, is that while SF never received ownership and experienced upside in the success of major silicon valley companies, Nouns would directly have ownership in Verse.

Logistically, there’s a couple ways the investment could work from a compliance & regulatory perspective. For starters, I’ve created an investment DAO through syndicate.io, which allows contributions in crypto (USDC or ETH). In exchange for the investment, NounsDAO would receive a proportional amount of tokens which represent ownership in this DAO. The associated legal entity for this DAO (an LLC acting as an investment SPV) would then be part of the cap table for Verse Labs, the legal entity building the Verse protocol. The SPV would in turn own the equity. Of course, this is just one option for formalizing the investment structure, and I’m happy to work with the nounders on any alternative structure that makes sense.

Overall, I’m excited to share this proposal with the Nouns community, and even more excited for the possibility to partner with the DAO on building fundamentally valuable NFT infrastructure with the Verse protocol.

# Summary

This is an invitation for the Nouns community to fund Ethereum public goods with 500 ETH through the Protocol Guild: a collective of protocol maintainers.

# Abstract

Nouns has established itself as a prominent Ethereum project for a number of reasons. These include the use of novel mechanisms, passionate membership, and a compelling long-term vision through its commitment towards funding and creating more public goods ([here](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1541959504576782336), [here](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) and [here](https://medium.com/@punk4156/funding-real-world-public-goods-with-the-nouns-dao-treasury-7939328acc12)). Underpinning it all, the community has tapped into the collective power generated by bundling individual motivations into a well-designed coordination mechanism.

Similarly, the Protocol Guild is purpose built to incentivize individual contributions through a collective mechanism. This parallel alignment could be enhanced by engaging each within the other: Nouns should fund the Protocol Guild Pilot. This “engine to engine” relationship:

* expresses the Nouns vision in new contexts
* facilitates a mutually beneficial exchange of narrative value and financial value
* weaves deeper meaning into the Nouns community story while reinforcing positive sum norms

“Ethereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games” ([Griffith, 2019](https://medium.com/@virgilgr/ethereum-is-game-changing-technology-literally-d67e01a01cf8)): we should manifest the collaborative opportunities enabled by this arena.

# Existing Mechanism / Funding Context

Watch / listen to this [Funding Ethereum with the Protocol Guild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVN97qA4gBs&list=PLhuBigpl7lqvMt8d7h4sbCmra9KbFmAdg&t) presentation or read below.

In Nov. 2021, a group of core Ethereum contributors started exploring the incentive mechanism proposed in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1454065104819916803?s=20&t=_ZC0BS5LfeCvaSbD4WxKKg) via this framing: What mechanism could help us better attract/retain talent and fund core protocol contributors?

We surfaced three challenges to address:

1. Curation is hard
  * Interested sponsors don’t have a single mechanism which curates all protocol contributors
  * Protocol contributors interested in receiving funding aren’t sure how to self-organize
  * Existing solutions bias towards teams & can’t surface all contributors
2. Incentives are imbalanced
  * Financial incentives are skewed towards newer projects with upside/tokens
  * Existing public goods funding solutions usually don’t consider exposure to upside to applications/L2s - eg. soliciting tokens from initial allocations or recurring revenue from existing projects
3. Churn is bad
  * Steep learning curve for new contributors to meaningfully contribute
  * Contributor value grows over time, but there is less incentive to stay once they are experts

# Protocol Guild

Through a lot of discussion and iteration, the **Protocol Guild** was formed: a collective of protocol contributors which actively maintains an onchain registry of its membership.

In response to the challenges above, the org was designed to carry out specific activities:

1. Self-curate an onchain registry of individuals
  * Sponsors only need to know a single contract address instead of many separate team addresses, they can trust that there is quality backing it
  * Members now have a single mechanism to coordinate around and solicit sponsorships to
  * Domain expert members can surface part time contribs or lower profile collaborators which may be missed by other existing mechanisms
2. Solicit sponsorships to balance financial incentives
  * Bootstrap with high profile DAO treasuries
  * Longterm, build norms around pre-allocation of a % of initial token supply
3. Incentivize long-term contributions
  * 6 month min before eligibility
  * Vesting gets people to stick around
  * Time weighted allocations to recognize the importance of long term contributors

To date, the membership includes over [110 Ethereum protocol contributors](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html), including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, tooling maintainers. This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 40% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated through quarterly updates to the split contract - we expect the membership to grow over the next year.

The Guild contracts are an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. Learn more about the smart contracts we are using for the Pilot [here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html).

# 2022 Pilot

Since starting the project in Nov 2021, we’ve built norms around member onboarding , refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and created extensive documentation on how it should be operated.

We’ve kicked off a test of the mechanism’s efficacy with a 1 year / $10mm Pilot. So far, we’ve raised $5.4mm (as of June 28 2022) from a number of notable communities, including:

* [2mm LDO from the Lido community](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-protocol-guild-pilot-via-a-lido-grant/2016)
* [200k ENS from the ENS community](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep13-executable-support-the-protocol-guild-pilot/12877)
* [500k UNI from the Uniswap community](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-should-the-uniswap-community-participate-in-the-protocol-guild-pilot/16824)

Secured funding can be tracked onchain through the [Pilot vesting contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/). We are currently engaging with a number of other notable projects to secure the remainder of the $10mm target.

# Proposal

We are inviting the Nouns community to contribute 500 ETH (2% of the treasury) to the 1 year Pilot vesting contract deployed at [theprotocolguild.eth](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/) (0xF29…f1a9).

The ETH will vest to each beneficiary members listed on the underlying split at [0x84af…8ea1](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0x84af3D5824F0390b9510440B6ABB5CC02BB68ea1/). Each recipient will make an independent decision about how to use the ETH once vested.

There are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild Pilot benefits the Nouns community:

* Nouns’ long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines:
  * [The Merge](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability
  * EVM improvements: new functionality for application developers like [EOF](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/evm-object-format-overview)
  * [Statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@gballet/Sy-a6T5St): sustainable management for state growth as the network scales
  * Supporting Layer 2 scaling: [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844), [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)
  * [Proposer Builder Separation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants
  * Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching and improving modular clients
  * Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades
* Pilot participation introduces a new facet for Nouns as a public goods funder
* Early support of a new mechanism recognizes another “fellow traveler” pushing the boundaries of incentive frameworks
* Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity

We hope that a successful Pilot will pave the way for future funding collaborations between Nouns and the Protocol Guild as we scale up. To that end, we think it’s important to demonstrate impact before we scale: learn more about how we will evaluate [Pilot outcomes here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5-initial-pilot.html). We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a full-scale fundraising round with longer vesting periods.",EXECUTED,15129250,15148960,0,37,,0,0,0,370,136,7,0,['500000000000000000000'],['0xf29ff96aaea6c9a1fba851f74737f3c069d4f1a9'],[''],15116110,1657472355,0x67254b7d7f25df95c3dd9465ba8ec461d9db1bcdb6beedd1c325ae6ec57239c5,['0x'],0x4c0a466df0628fe8699051b3ac6506653191cc21

## TL;DR
Today, Nouns clothes are limited to drop-shipped, plug-n-play merch. Our goal is to create a cut and sewn Nouns clothing line to seed through public channels with the intention of building brand familiarity outside of web3.

The team behind Nouns Brand is highly experienced in web3 and fashion. Among other things, we recently created the [Creature World x Advisry](https://twitter.com/creatureworld/status/1477758094667100161?s=20&t=yli7rD42olxZUdtHNwnQjA) clothing collection.

# Why Nouns Brand?
⌐◨-◨ is the full stack of web3 with a dash of magic. Nouns implies quality and creativity, but also carries a whiff of mass culture which has the potential to turn the noses of consumers outside of the know.

From a business perspective, the full-speed push into tasteful clothing that pulls from Nouns imagery is a logical step forward. What is cc0 without encouraging designers and artists the freedom to take Nouns creative assets and explore? *The next generation of artists will wear Nouns.*

### Proposal
**Fund Nouns Brand ⌐◨-◨ to**:
- design, manufacture, and produce artisanal garments (entirely **cut & sew**, *not* plug and play)
- open a channel of collaboration between legacy brands and Nouns
- seed Nouns clothing via PR, publications, and marketing media

**How does it benefit the DAO?**
- For the cost of ~3.5 days of auctions, we can add a creative vertical to Nouns that expands the audience and inspires future builders. Nouns esports(*jersey/tracksuit concept in bottom left corner of mockup*)  is an unexpected vertical that has already onboarded enough people to return a multiple of the funding amount to the DAO. 
- Entire collection **free for Noun holders** (1-time use code, 1 free item per style), **forever**.

# Costs

### Pre-Production (100Ξ)

**Design Fee and Materials**
Design, pattern-making, cost of fabrics, and labor costs.

**Sampling Costs**

# Future of Nouns Brand
*This section contains our vision for what the future of Nouns Brand could be and is **outside the scope** of this prop.*

Fashion is gatekept, we believe art is for everyone. To encourage others to start their own creative journeys, our dream is to create a direct-to-consumer white label service for artists to make their own clothes through Nouns Brand. We will use Nouns Blanks to allow people to print designs and empower people to create, built on Nouns.

### Collaborations
**Nouns Brand can be a channel for collaboration as companies seek partners in bridging the gaps of the sacred and profane: web2 and web3.** 

Work with aligning companies we have relationships with to create limited collaborations with Nouns through Nouns Brand, our wish list includes:
- Nouns Esports - gaming (jersey design and partnerships with Gunnar Optics, G Fuel, etc.)
- Gucci - fashion
- Carrots - streetwear
- Adidas - fashion/footwear
- Dr Martens - footwear
- Crocs - footwear
- Swatch, Casio - watches
- Tiffany & Co - jewelry
- Rimowa - luggage
- Ikea - furniture

### Direct-To-Consumer White Label Service
- We will wholesale our Nouns Brand blanks and develop a white label service for emerging artists to create their own clothes
- Nouns White Label Facility
- Custom color ways of Nouns blanks: Nouns Dye House
- Team of print and embroidery specialists to customize Nouns blanks, such as t-shirts, hoodies, hats, etc.
    - Blanks are made to supply the clothing industry. Blank clothing has no added decoration. Many clothing ""labels"" begin with a good blank, add their own logos, designs or trimmings, re-label and on-sell to retailers, or sell direct at markets, online, etc.
- DTG Print & Embroidery Machines
- White Label Fulfillment Team
- Wholesale Blank Accounts

### The Nounge (Shop)
We envision a Nouns brick and mortar store, the Nounge, in the Soho neighborhood of New York City. An experiential Nouns Brand space to shop and serve as a storefront for collaboration activations. The Nounge will also serve as the premiere carrier for Nouns Coffee in NY.

- Brick-and-mortar shop
- Activation site for brand collaborations and events
- Accepts Fiat and Crypto as payment method
- Photography Studio for emerging Nouns projects

# Why should we care about Nouns Brand?
Nouns Brand is *not* just a capsule collection — it’s branding built on taste, with the goal of seeding the world with Nouns you can wear, feel, and see. Nouns is a brand that can stand on its own, among the golden arches and box logos. Nouns is about empowerment, giving people the keys to their future, following creativity, being inspired, and it starts with us.

## TL;DR
Nouns On The Ground requests to manage The Proliferation Pod Fund for 6 months as an important decentralized DAO marketing experiment, which includes 4 major NFT event activations.

## NOUNS ON THE GROUND ⌐◧-◧

Nouns On The Ground began as a conceptual idea exploring ways to bring Nouns out into the world IRL and has quickly become the foundation for an experimental proliferation pod within the Nouns ecosystem. With just one month of scheduling time, NounsOTG was able to plan, coordinate and complete its first multi-day activation at NFT.NYC, resulting in some planned and some unexpected exposure for the [Nouns](https://www.nouns.wtf) brand at one of the leading industry events of the year.

![NFT NYC](https://imgur.com/tLh2n5Z.png)

### Key Moments From This Activation

 - Activations inside the NFT.NYC event all three days at the different event locations
 - Gnars event in Time Square where we met other nounish projects
 - Filmed at the Noun mural with the nounish film crew / [Proposal 64](https://nouns.wtf/vote/64)
 - Unexpected/surprise filming with Shopify putting NounsDAO in their official NFT video
 - In-studio filming with Stoopid Buddy / [Proposal 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73)
 - Sandbox event at Gotham Hall, introduced Andy Milonakis to Nouns and the different forks
 - Noun O’Clock meetups IRL / On-site hosting
 - Met notable NFT musicians and began conversation that led to a feature performance by a #1 musician in the Noun O’Clock space
 - Connected with other nounish builders and people from Prop.House

![NFT NYC](https://imgur.com/gWur0ZO.png)

### Clear Takeaways From This Activation
 - IRL is important to solidify proliferation of the Nouns
 - IRL invites unexpected growth opportunities for Nouns
 - “On The Ground” promotion is an effective decentralized marketing tool
 - IRL brand recognition creates authentic and memorable user connection

![Shopify Ad](https://imgur.com/d4v1R97.png)

## WHAT’S NEXT? ⌐◐-◐

More events, more proliferation and more recognition! **Nouns On The Ground** wants to replicate and scale the success of NFT.NYC for the Nouns, by targeting 4 other major key hubs for future Nouners and Nounish builders. To clarify, **Nouns On The Ground** will be working to replicate the ROI and general recognition of the NFT.NYC activation. Flexible “on the ground” event planning is an important element, keeping the process decentralized, new and always changing. The goal of The **Proliferation Pod** will be to create new and unique experiences catered to each event.

The **Proliferation Pod** will manage the Proposal amount to cover the costs of these events. ETH funding will need to be converted to USD to cover travel costs, merch/swag orders and other event related fees. The same budget used for the NFT.NYC event, which was 6 ETH, totals to 11 ETH today to adjust for the change in ETH price since initial funding. **Nouns On The Ground** can replicate these activations for the same amount as previously proven in New York with a slight added cost for travel for NFT London.

![IRL Events](https://imgur.com/uJYIXYl.png)

### NFT3 AWARDS (August 5-7) in Los Angeles, CA (11 ETH)

A unique event that has started garnering attention from musicians and artists utilizing NFTs. The NFT3 Awards in Los Angeles and will have over 16,000 attendees which is roughly the same size as NFT.NYC. The NFT3 Awards will be the premiere NFT summer event on the West Coast. Nouns On The Ground will immediately begin planning this next activation. This will create consistency throughout the US NFT markets, as the Nouns meme continues to spread across the world in Rio, Sweden, Tokyo and more.

I will have swag and merch on hand for “ Noggle recognition awards”, multiple hidden AR POAP dispensers for event POAP collecting and of course, more stickers and buttons with 10 newly featured Nouns to hit the ground. DM if you want your Noun featured this time! I will continue to post updates in this thread as we get closer to the event.

### NOUNS DOTA FINALS (August 10-14) in Arlington, TX (11 ETH)

The currently undefeated NOUNS DOTA team is a guarantee for the Finals. We need Nouns On The Ground to proliferate Nouns throughout the stadium, amongst the Nouns fans and entire audience. We’ve started throwing around the idea of Noggle sports towels. Nouns On The Ground is in the NounsEsports Discord and ready to coordinate other live events to bring well deserved attention to this highly successful NounsDAO Proposal. This would be the best event of the 5 for a big T-shirt order as well.

### NFT NASHVILLE (September 1-5) in Nashville, TN (11 ETH)

NFT Nashville is striving to be the premiere NFT music event of the South as it brings a “festival-like” NFT event to the heart of the music capital during the Labor Day weekend. Some of the top current NFT music artists, including Sammy Ariaga, call Nashville home and have set the tone for NFT Nashville to enter the music scene with a bang. After starting through local meet-ups, NFT Nashville has quickly set a precedent for community building within this industry and the presence of the Nouns is necessary for proliferation.

### NFT LONDON (November 6-7) in London, United Kingdom (18 ETH)

NFT.London is being organized by the same team behind NFT.NYC, so you can already guarantee this will be one of Europe’s main NFT events of the year. With people already tweeting about grabbing tickets to this event, it is a no brainer to have Nouns fully on the ground in the UK. There is a slight increase in the funding cost for this event to account for additional travel costs.

### ART BASEL MIAMI BEACH (December 1-4) in Miami, FL (11 ETH)

Art Basel is another fantastic event for NFTs and proliferation of the Nouns Brand. Last year’s event in Miami Beach was the launchpad for some of the largest brands currently in the industry. This event is known for setting art trends and the Nouns meme needs to be logged in event attendee memories to close out the year in a strong way.

### NOUNS ON THE GROUND OPERATION COSTS (18 ETH)

Why choose Aubtoshi and Nouns On The Ground for these events? I have a proven successful track record with this type of proliferation and have modeled my plans for each of these 4 events after the successful New York multi-day activation. The job will get done with added elements of surprise and key events that always arise when engaging IRL. I am also involved with multiple Nounish projects that also seek to proliferate the Nouns brand and have incorporated these projects during my activations as well.

NounsDAO funding Nouns On The Ground to operate in this fashion will allow this proven project to grow and scale without having to come to the DAO per each event. Proliferating the Nouns is the goal. I would love for NounsDAO to continue to let me show you the wonderful, creative and unexpected ways we can do just that, on the ground, IRL!

## TOTAL PROPOSAL ASK: 92 ETH ($110,400) over 6 months ⌐Ξ-Ξ
***ETH calculated at 1 ETH = $1,200 USD**
***15% added for volatility w/any extra being sent back to NounsDAO**

Instead of having multiple proposals for each event as they come, this one proposal will cover the costs of these events planned within a 6 month period. The amount will be held in a multi-sig wallet, in USD, that will release funds in the following manner:


**IMMEDIATE** - Initial release for Event 1 & Event 1.5 & Op: 25 ETH ($30,000 USD)
08/01/22 - Release for Event 2 & Op: 14 ETH ($16,800 USD)
09/01/22 - Release for Event 3 & Op: 21 ETH ($25,200 USD)
10/01/22 - Release for Event 4 & Op: 14 ETH ($16,800 USD)
11/01/22 - Release for Op: 3 ETH ($3,600 USD)
12/01/22 - Release for Op: 3 ETH ($3,600 USD)
**Total: 80 ETH ($96,000 USD)** distributed through 6 transactions over the course of 6 months (July 2022-Dec 2022) as outlined above

At the suggestion made by Seneca above, we have added 15% to account for volatility:

15% Increase added for volatility to 80 ETH = 12 ETH ($14,400)
Total ETH ask including 15% increase for volatility = 92 ETH
Total USD ask including 15% increase for volatility = $110,400 USD

**PLEASE NOTE:** All ETH not used strictly for reasons relating to volatility in ETH price will be sent back to the NounsDAO from the multi-sig wallet.

There will be 3 individuals for the 2/3 signers verification to ensure proper distribution of funds on the correct date. 

**Signer 1**: Aubtoshi
**Signer 2**: 142
**Signer 3**: Seneca

![Dominoe Effect](https://imgur.com/ctVSkv9.png)


An additional part of the overall success of Nouns On The Ground Proliferation Pod will come through collaboration with other Nounish builders. Please reach out via [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/NounsOTG) or Discord (aubtoshi#9612) to talk all things collab!

## LONG-TERM “NOUNISH” GOALS ⌐◪-◪
This experimental Proliferation Pod is the next clear step for Nouns On The Ground as an appropriate scaling measure. Aubtoshi isn’t going anywhere and will continue to bring value to this community. A personal long-term goal is to be a woman Nouner. Until I have the opportunity to join the community as an official Nouner, I will continue to proliferate the Nouns in the most fun and effective ways that I can make possible. Thank you Nouners for giving me this chance to show you what we can do together, On The Ground!

![](https://i.imgur.com/cEKQzYk.png)

Hi, this is [Noun 22](https://nouns.wtf/noun/22).  

I have had the absolute pleasure of building on Nouns DAO as a Core Contributor for the better part of this year, and would love nothing more than if the DAO would support me to continue working for the DAO with the majority of my time.

### Background

After joining Nouns DAO in the first month of the project's inception, I have been fortunate enough to have the DAO's unanimous support to be compensated to work for the DAO in a variety of roles.
* November 2021 - `Proposal 17` ([On-Chain](https://nouns.wtf/vote/17) / [Proposal](https://hackmd.io/@noun22/first-residency)) funded my trial residency as a community contributor for the DAO
* February 2022 - `Proposal 38` ([On-Chain](https://nouns.wtf/vote/38) / [Proposal](https://hackmd.io/@noun22/core-contributor)) funded me to continue my work on the protocol as a Core Contributor for six months

My current contract is set to expire on August 24 2022, and this proposal would renew my contract with the DAO for another 6 months.

### My Work on Nouns
**1. Small Grants (SG)**

The Nouns DAO Small Grants and Retroactive Funding Pool was originally formed in [November 2021](https://nouns.wtf/vote/13).  Since then, SG has evolved into flexible pool of capital that is managed on a fully discretionary basis to serve the DAO's interests in a variety of ways.

I am the lead for SG and I manage its day to day operations.  As the DAO has grown, incoming inquiry has scaled with it.  Running SG is what I spend most of my time on every day.  The group does not presently have an operational budget, and my compensation for this work is included as part of my role as Core Contributor. 

I'm very proud of what has been accomplished so far at SG.  The group has funded many builders and projects (detailed below) that have generated tremendous value for the DAO.  Many of the DAO's most successful proposals started as a trial sponsored by SG, and many of the DAO's most valuable community members were funded/onboarded by SG when they first joined the community.  In my experience running SG for the better part of a year, I have seen many instances in which a 1 ETH grant can generate more value to the DAO than an 100+ ETH proposal.  The crypto ecosystem is rife with rugs and scams, and that is precisely why our generosity on the individual level leaves such a lasting impression and inspires such fierce loyalty.

Today, SG serves multiple roles for the DAO: we are the DAO's working capital, a Nounish venture pod, and an onboarding tool. SG has the flexibility to quickly:
* Fund exciting smaller proposals (in concert with Prop House)
* Vet new builders and derisk new projects by funding trials ahead of sponsoring larger on-chain proposals
* Be a first point of contact and source of funding to onboard new community members 
* Retroactively reward builders 
* Provide time-sensitive and milestone based funding as a part of larger proposals
* Fill other ad hoc daily capital needs of the DAO (contests, bug bounties, etc)

My daily work on SG includes:
* Engaging with community members that request funding
* Providing feedback on and tracking multiple proposals
* Monitoring and responding to new inquiry over Discord and [Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/u/noun22/activity)
* Diligencing proposals to prevent waste and fraud
* Negotiating funding terms
* Following up with funded builders
* Building a relationship with new builders and onboarding them deeper into the Nouns ecosystem
* Administrative tasks  

I conduct the majority of SG's operations on [Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/u/noun22/activity) and in the `#grants-and-retro-funding` channel in the Nouns DAO Discord.  

Since inception, SG has funded 100+ builders with over 230 ETH.  [This link contains information on everything SG has funded to date](https://noun22.notion.site/noun22/Nouns-DAO-Small-Grants-ac22114a6c004bafa500e2d824e32dc3).  Some highlights from the track record:
* Trial for the Nouns Vision luxury glasses by [Salvino Armati](https://twitter.com/SalvinoArmati) that led to [Proposal 57](https://nouns.wtf/vote/57)
* [Lil Nouns](https://lilnouns.wtf/)
* Trial for Fun Noggles by [Bigshot Klim](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-functional-noun-glasses/685) which led to [Proposal 56](https://nouns.wtf/vote/56) 
* [Nouns Mural in SoHo during NFT NYC](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1536765342445359104?s=20&t=qL6HN2lEVWb2TdrdrB3Kmw)
* Funded maty to build the [proposal dashboard](https://maty-eth.notion.site/maty-eth/NounsDAO-Proposals-Overview-b8c76e6ac8e44515966ee032ea20f860) with the status of all On-Chain and Prop House proposals, the [Nouns newsletter](https://nouns.substack.com/), and [Prop House proposal summaries](https://maty-eth.notion.site/maty-eth/9cf308a53bc6437ab6d56d4d66fb55c2?v=9ba27c16f6f947d2bc0590314ac7346b)

* Trial for The Noun Square that led to [Proposal 101](https://nouns.wtf/vote/101)

* Funded aubtoshi for [Nouns on the Ground](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-on-the-ground-nft-nyc-activation/1215) during NFT NYC that led to an [Proposal 110](https://nouns.wtf/vote/110)
* Trial for Messhup's coloring book pages that led to [Proposal 34](https://nouns.wtf/vote/34) and the [Coloring Book Contest](https://twitter.com/undeadnoun22/status/1478085928602279936) 
* Trial for [FOMO v2](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-fomo-v2/1317), to expand [FOMO](https://fomonouns.wtf/), one of the DAO's most [successful proposals](https://nouns.wtf/vote/8).
* [Noggle AR Filters for social media](https://noggles.wtf/)
* Ad hoc Twitter contests - [4156 Noun O'Clock](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1534250110963568641?s=20&t=8HDo-zHgcvHcdgFwNs-Ekg), [Nounify The Superbowl](https://twitter.com/nounsdao/status/1492623223900549120)
* [Nounish Jingles](https://twitter.com/natemillsart)
* [The immediate retroactive reward for the discovery of ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/mattdowney)
* Small Grants has been the initial source of funding that contributed to the onboarding of some of the DAO's most active and engaged community members, including maty, Joel Cares, Messhup, Salvino, Noadz, aubtoshi, and many other Nouncil members

My vision for the future of SG:
* Continue to generate value for Nouns DAO by seeding high potential projects and builders in the ecosystem 
* Build a pipeline of more ambitious trials and sponsor them as on-chain proposals
* Improved comms / organization -  I am exploring tools to have a central location for all funding requests and other information
* Continue to innovate on new ways for SG to add value to Nouns DAO


**2. Community Building: Onboarding New Nouners / Weekly Calls**

Since I first joined the DAO a year ago, I have reached out to every new member to organize an onboarding call.  To date, I have done over 100+ of these calls.  If you are voting this proposal, we have likely had one of these calls - if we haven't please reach out to me on Discord!

Additionally, I host the weekly [US Nouner Town Hall call every Tuesday at 5:30pm ET](https://hackmd.io/@noun22/nounweekly).  The call initially started as an informal meet and greet where we first got the opportunity to hear each other's voices and get to know each other, and has evolved into a more structured format where we discuss and form consensus on topical issues.  

I host these calls not just to meet and build relationships with fascinating, cool, like-minded people, but I view them as integral to creating and strengthening a sense of community within the DAO.

Nouns is the most exciting and innovative project in crypto, but we cannot become complacent and view our success as inevitable.  The DAO's greatest long term threat is member apathy and disengagement - particularly as we have entered into what may be a lasting crypto bear market.  Members who feel lost or confused will quickly become inactive members, and the DAO will suffer as a result.

I will continue to use my experience in the role to foster an atmosphere of open communication and experimentation where every community member feels they are able to contribute to the DAO.  Everyone needs to feel that their opinions are heard and their proposal ideas are fairly considered.  In my role, I try and be a neutral go-between and source of feedback to maintain harmony within the DAO.  

My involvement with Nouns has been the absolute high point of my career.  I have never felt this level of excitement and optimism about my work.  Thanks for reading this, and I look forward to continuing to Nounify The World with you all ⌐◨-◨


### Compensation
Being a Core Contributor for Nouns DAO is a unique role within a unique organization.  I hope this proposal has demonstrated the value I have generated for Nouns DAO, my passion for this organization, and convinced you of why I am uniquely suited to continue in this role going foward.

The nominal $ value of my last contract with the DAO was $32k per month for 6 months.  For this contract I propose an extension at the same nominal $ rate:
* 6 month term
* Nominal $32k per month paid in USDC
* Nouns DAO can vote to cancel the contract at any point
* ETH to be sent to the SG multi-sig address and a portion will converted to USDC upon receipt
* Funds will be put into a Sablier contract that commences on August 25 2022 with a 6 month duration",EXECUTED,15141388,15161098,0,37,,0,0,0,373,117,1,23,['180000000000000000000'],['0x2af21e37928613582734bcbaead0919801a4cacf'],[''],15128248,1657634878,0x7cd47c3296836742d39a38acff1e329aa72548f97dbe5f8a9ce18e78c045b8cb,['0x'],0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e

### Goal

Continue the Dota and Esports experiment! Extending the signing of our Dota roster until after [The International](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/The_International) in October, with the mission to proliferate Nouns through esports competition.

### Description

[Nouns Esports](https://twitter.com/nounsesports) was founded with the passing of [Proposal 68](https://nouns.wtf/vote/68), which brought a Professional Dota team under the Nouns banner. They won a large North American tournament and currently have a 6-1 standing in the Dota Pro Circuit ""DPC"" - the most important qualifier matches leading to the biggest tournament in the world, [The International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_(Dota_2)). 

The teams' current term with the DAO will end on July 17th, after the DPC. Because of their DPC standing, they currently have a strong probability of attending the upcoming Arlington Major in August. Since our current proposal ends before this event, it makes sense to extend their term with the DAO. Their success in the rest of the DPC and the Major will determine if they qualify directly to The International.

If you want to learn more about Prop #68, an [accountability report](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-esports-pod/1030/5) was posted detailing how funds from the proposal were spent.

    - Sasquatch took no compensation per the [accountability report](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-esports-pod/1030/5) 
    - Organizing this project - shipping both props, operating the multi-sig, managing esports operations, and acting as a liaison between the team and Nouns DAO.

We are also adding 30 ETH to our on-chain ask in order to account for ETH/DAI volatility. ETH will be converted to match the estimated DAI distribution shared - surplus ETH will be returned to the DAO.

### Dota Pod

We will be using the same multi-sig that was created via Proposal 68 consisting of Nouners and Nounsfolk. We will be swapping in Nouners Brian Cho and Oni to replace Wag and Goldy.

### Deliverables
- Competitive Results
    - From the Pilot (#68 proposal)...
        - They won the [BTS Pro Series Season 11: Americas](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/BTS/Pro_Series/11/Americas) 
        - They are currently 6-1 and tied for first place in the DPC North America rankings. While not yet guaranteed, they have positioned themselves to have an excellent shot at attending the upcoming Major in Arlington, Texas.
    - During this signing, past potentially competing in the Major they will have an opportunity to compete in the ESL Malaysia qualifiers, and qualifiers for The International. 
- Tournament Stream Viewership
    - Tournament matches during the pilot have regularly received between 10,000 and 40,000 viewers. If the team qualifies for any of the upcoming international events, viewership will be a few multiples higher.
        - The International 2021 had [2,700,000 peak viewers](https://escharts.com/events/international), excluding China.
- Individual Stream Viewership
    - Players individually stream and regularly present the Nouns brand on stream
        - Our player Gunnar has been the most active streamer regularly getting a [few thousand viewers.](https://twitchtracker.com/gunnardota2)
- In-game Branding
    - Dota allows for DPC teams to have in-game branding through assets placed inside of the game's landscape. We have used this to show off Noggles during all of the tournament games in front of tens of thousands of viewers.
- Name Branding
    - The team will continue to operate as Nouns/Nouns Esports.
- Player Name Branding
    - Player names will include a Nounish sponsor tag in-game e.g. nouns.PlayerName.⌐◨-◨",EXECUTED,15150687,15170397,0,37,,0,0,0,374,117,1,1,['129694200000000000000'],['0xa46036c5554ae85599715422c71f8691d7c5d2e7'],[''],15137547,1657758960,0x2b1a2a8fc5988160cf904de066d84de96827babc4c362e04e31cd481200ee768,['0x'],0xe3f27deff96fe178e87559f36cbf868b9e75967d

# Hi, Nouners **⌐◨-◨**.

We’re [Ordinary Folk](http://www.ordinaryfolk.co). Allow us to introduce ourselves…

[![Ordinary Folk Reel](https://i.imgur.com/LV2e5A7.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M7osmhGv5v4HIvtN321pnJa1EXrdTY4J/view?)

💻 You can see more of our work [here](http://www.ordinaryfolk.co/work).
 

We’re a big fan of NFTs and explaining complex ideas — simply and beautifully. We’ve been doing it for a while with companies you may have heard of, and we’d like to do it for you.

# Proposal

We propose commissioning Ordinary Folk to create a 1-2 minute fully animated video. Explaining Nouns, how they work and why the community is so valuable.

# But, why?

We know Nouns are awesome, but scrolling through all this? 

Not so awesome.

![webNavGIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/YwFuI4outa3r6PYdlj/giphy.gif)

A much better way to go through this information is with an animated explainer. Sure, we're biased, but the facts remain that explainers have the power to communicate complex and vast amounts of information in a short and entertaining way.

We think a project of this caliber deserves nothing but the best, and a clear explainer that explains the function and reason behind Nouns will really bring Nouns to more eyes, normies, and degens alike.

# Summary

Ordinary Folk would leverage our production expertise to manage, creative direct, storyboard, design, animate, and facilitate the composition of an original score, and voice-over recording for a Nouns animated explainer. The full production package.

## Creative Commons

All of our deliverables will be CC0 with open source files.

![webNavGIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/USgwvuKFBz60A7S5hY/giphy.gif)

# Ordinary Folk’s Process

We trust the process, and ours is highly iterative and linear. Feedback will be managed differently than in other projects given the nature of the DAO, more specifically:

When the project is executed, Ordinary Folk will build out a milestone schedule to send the DAO regular updates requesting specific feedback and guidance on the tone, voice, direction of the animation. 

All Nouners and community will have the opportunity to comment for each work-in-progress in discord for 24 hours. How and if we apply the feedback will be up to our discretion and expertise.

That said, given the nature of the script writing process, we would ask that we can have at least 1 Nounder that we can have 2 or 3 script conversations with to make sure the messaging is exactly what it needs to be.

Starting with the first concept review, Nouners and community are directly involved in developing the product in a tangible way and Ordinary Folk will guide and decide on how to execute the project for the best product.

💡 From award to delivery, the process generally takes ~8 - 10 weeks



Here’s an overview…

---
## Step 1: Scripting

Animation is a visual and audio storytelling medium but you always start with a good foundation — the script. Messaging in animation is a balance of showing and telling. We'll first focus on having the script stand on its own while building a plan for the visuals and sound.

💡 Scripting generally takes ~1 - 2 weeks

## Storyboarding, Design, & Animation

While we work on locking down the script and recording the voice-over, we’ll also be working on creative direction, storyboards, design, sound, and animation. 

Here are a few examples of each step:

## Step 2: Storyboarding

![storyboard01](https://i.imgur.com/QQJnRUu.png)

![storyboard02](https://i.imgur.com/ijYffAY.png)


### Storyboarding Animatic

*Storyboard Animatic for School of Motion.*

## Step 3: Design / Styleframes

![styleframe05](https://i.imgur.com/4ibNpPg.jpg)
![styleframe06](https://i.imgur.com/nmN8FNU.png)

## Step 4: Animation

The process of animation is very intentional, tedious AND the most exciting phase when you begin to see elements from the designs come to life. 

We'll send a series of videos showing our work in progress (WIP). WIPs may also come in the form of motion tests or a series of gifs. When we have enough motion compiled together we'll send videos that are a mix of still a motion to show our progress.

*School of Motion WIP Example.*

## Step 5: Sound

### Voice Over

When the script is locked we'll begin the casting for a VO actor. From there we'll have the actor record the script.

### Score & SFX

The composer will begin scoring when we have a locked animatic with the final VO timing. We'll constantly be tweaking the score and animation to match and elevate each other.

Sound design (the process of adding sound effects) and sound mixing (adjusting the levels of the VO, score, and sound effects.) are the finishing touches of our projects. Adding a final level of polish to our work.

114,Descriptor V2 Upgrade,"# Descriptor V2 Upgrade

This proposal activates a new version of the Nouns Descriptor contract, which contains many improvements upon the previous version. The Descriptor is the contract that stores and renders Noun artwork and token metadata.

**Descriptor Improvements**:

* Significantly cheaper on-chain art deployment, which largely benefits builders that fork the Nouns protocol. The gas required to deploy the Nouns artwork has been reduced nearly 5x.
* Improved external API, which boosts composability by allowing external contracts to more easily hook into the Noun artwork and rendering engine.
* Improved descriptor upgradability. The new descriptor separates the artwork, renderer, and facilitator contracts, which enable much cheaper upgrades (e.g. trait retirement).

**Note**: This proposal is separate from the 8/8 art additions, which will be proposed separately in the coming weeks.

* [Specification](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-tech/blob/main/descriptor-v2/README.md)
* [Pull Request](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/499)

This code has been reviewed by multiple technical community members, has unit/integration test coverage, and has been tested on both Rinkeby and Mainnet.

In addition, we’ve retroactively fixed seven art errors and oversights. These fixes will not only apply to art moving forward, but will reach back in time to correct Nouns that contain the offending traits. All fixes are either recoloring of existing pixels or removing of extra pixels. Most errors are likely a result of iteration and palette color reduction prior to the launch of Nouns - some that melded two colors into one, or put two formerly-different colors closer to one another. No pixels are being added in this update. Emoji voting in discord indicated support for this effort.

![](https://i.imgur.com/SSAquuV.png)

**Piggybank**: Removal of cluster of erroneous pixels around the tail region.

Reason for error: Oversight.

**Beer**: There are several pixels that are only slightly off in color. They've been filled in with the correct color so it's all one full-bodied beer.

Reason for error: Weirdness created by palette color reduction.

**Multicolored glasses**: There are inconsistent rules applied to this trio of frames, resulting in a distracting appearance from one to the next. Additionally, this fix helps retain the frame shape unless they're going to blend into the head, which is an anomaly.

Reason for error: Oversight.

**Watermelon frames**: These were the same color as the Guava frames. This pushes them into riper, melony territory.

Reason for error: Likely palette crushing creating weirdness.

**Fog Grey body**: This was the same color as CRT beige. This pushes it into foggier, greyer territory.

Reason for error: Weirdness created by palette color reduction.

115,Nouns DAO at FWB FEST,"# Nouns DAO at FWB FEST 

**TLDR**
This August, the Friends with Benefits community will be hosting [FWB FEST](https://fest.fwb.help), a three day immersive conference and festival to discuss the current state of how Web3 is affecting culture. 

Over forty keynote talks, performances, and sessions have been programmed by the community to take place over this 72 hour symposium. FWB is looking for support from Nouns DAO to publicly amplify these conversations to the wider Web3 community and beyond, under CC0 and a content distribution partnership. 

Additionally, we’d like to use this as an opportunity to craft a culturally oriented session around Nouns DAO at the conference, while bridging our communities together through this DAO-to-DAO collaboration. 

**Who We Are**
Friends with Benefits is a worldwide group of creators, thinkers, and builders who sit at the intersection of Web3 and culture. As one of the earliest social token communities, FWB’s members span a diverse range from the heavily crypto native to the more recently, and eagerly, onboarded. 

**Introducing FWB FEST**
Between August 12-14, 2022, FWB will be hosting the inaugural [FWB FEST](https://fest.fwb.help) in Idyllwild, California to bring together our global community to discuss how Web3 will continue to shape the future of culture. 

The FWB community aims to grow FWB FEST into a premier conference that annually showcases leading topics and conversations around how Web3 is affecting culture. 

*FWB FEST will:*
* Gather ~500 community members IRL 
* Livestream the event to thousands more digitally 
* Take over the historic 200+ acre campus of the Idyllwild Arts Academy in the San Jacinto Mountains outside of Los Angeles
* Feature a world class speaking and music lineup including:

Performances: James Blake, Pussy Riot, Oneohtrix Point Never, L’Rain, Weyes Blood, Mustafa, and more 

Speakers: Hayden Adams (Uniswap), Nadya Tolokonnikova (Pussy Riot, Unicorn DAO), David Rudnick, Meltem DeMirors, Glen Wyl (Radical Exchange, DeSoc), Toby Shorin (Other Internet), Kei Kreutler (Gnosis), Yancey Strickler (Metalabel, Kickstarter) & More

Full lineup [here](https://fest.fwb.help/).

![](https://i.imgur.com/JLnuCD7.jpg) 




**How can we partner?**

**FWB FEST Content Co-Brand and Distribution** 
FWB, with support from Nouns, will capture and record the keynote talks from FWB FEST and make these talks publicly accessible to the world under CC0 through concise video formats. All talks would include Nouns DAO logo placement.

Keynote sample conversations at FWB FEST include:

*Cultural Currency*
Nadya Tolokonnikova (PussyRiot, Unicorn DAO), Hayden Adams (Founder, Uniswap), Trevor McFedries (Brud & FWB)

*Future of Identity & Soul Bound Tokens*
Glen Weyl (Author, Radical Markets), Christopher Kulendran Thomas (Founder, EARTH), Puja Ohlhaver (Researcher)

![](https://i.imgur.com/Hxr1GRg.jpg)


**Nouns DAO Keynote Talk at FWB FEST** 
FWB will organize a keynote talk with and about Nouns, giving people a chance to contextualize Nouns in both an IRL and a thought leadership context. This talk would be crafted in collaboration with Nouns holders to ensure proper representation and storytelling, and would be crafted in collaboration with Jacob Horne and other outspoken Nouners.

The keynote talk will be hosted live at FWB FEST in front of an audience of ~500 guests, and will be recorded, edited, and distributed as one of the highlighted talks at FWB FEST. 

The main objective will be to contribute public content about Nouns DAO that is tasteful, personable, culturally aligned, and encapsulates a different perspective than the current existing Youtube explainer video formats.


**Hosting Nouns DAO on NFT Pirate Radio** 
As part of this strategy we would also invite Nouns representatives to speak on our most popular digital program, NFT Pirate Radio. 

NFT Pirate Radio is presented in collaboration with OpenSea on Twitter Spaces and averages 2,000+ live listeners for each episode. Previous guests of Pirate Radio show include: David Choe, Aaron Penne, Mindy Seu, Andrew Benson, Vivian Fu & Noah Kalina (JPEG2000), and Possessed. 

All NFT Pirate Radio sessions are also recorded and will eventually live as evergreen assets to be further amplified. 

**FWB Works in Progress**
Lastly, we would commission a writer within the FWB community to meaningfully tell a story about why Nouns DAO represents an interesting model for brand proliferation via a long-form written piece on FWB Works in Progress, our editorial platform. 

Past pieces WIP include:
What Co-Ops and DAOs Can Learn From Each Other by Austin Robey which has garnered 300,000+ impressions. 

In addition to the media strategy above, FWB would integrate Nouns DAO in a few other ways.

**Recognition as official partner of FWB FEST** 
As an official partner, Nouns branding would be included on the FWB FEST website as well as the FWB newsletter, social media accounts, FEST promotional assets, and on-site guide. 


**Nouns DAO Ticket Raffle for Nouns Community** 
Nouns DAO to receive 10 FWB.FEST NFT tickets to raffle off and give away to Noun community members. 

**Why?** 
We believe this is a meaningful initiative for the Nouns community because it will:

* Democratize and distribute the keynote talks and conversations at FWB FEST for the entire Web3 community to consume, irrespective of location and travel ability.
* Contribute effective storytelling and thought leadership about Nouns DAO with a cultural perspective and lens 
* Leverage FWB FEST with its high concentration of web3 native and culturally aligned community members. 
* Utilize additional FWB distribution channels like Pirate Radio and FWB Works in Progress to further amplify Nouns storytelling from a cultural perspective 
* Create an initial playbook that Nouns can use to further collaborate with other DAOs
* Support FWB in its endeavor to create a premier conference and festival experience bridging Web3 and Culture


**Funds Requested** 
30 ETH | Video Production Team: Equipment, Labor, Time, Housing, Travel, and Editing
30 ETH  Stage Production, Lighting, Sound, Venue, and Hard Costs
10 ETH | FWB FEST Tickets for NounsDAO
5 ETH | FWB Editorial Commission
5 ETH | FWB Pirate Radio Nouns Talk Production

Total: 80 ETH

All deliverables will be executed between FWB FEST (August 12-14) and September 30th, accounting for proper editing, marketing, and distribution time. 

**Who Is Behind This Proposal?**

Members of the FWB Community & Team Including:
Gabe Quintela, Partnerships
Lindsay Howard, Curatorial & Brand
Alex Zhang, Mayor
Paul Tao, Events, Operations
Zach Tetreault, Programming

Tl;dr
A monthly cc0 Nouns comic for Nationwide Distribution.

An initial 6-issue series would be commissioned for a total of $210,000 USD, paid for by selling 7,000 copies of each issue with an exclusive cover to NounsDAO, to be distributed (or sold) as seen fit. The money will be used to pay for all the creatives as well as ensure the work is owned by NounsDAO (both writing and artwork).

The team, led by DefaultedUser, a 25-year veteran of comics publishing, will create a comic meant to be released not only to the Web3 community but to comic book stores via Titan Comics and to book stores via Penguin Random House.

The Community will be allowed to vote on aspects of the publishing project starting in July 2022, with the first issue to release to the community in November 2022, and the mass market in March 2023.

After issue #6, profits will be used to publish future issues, still with community involvement, as well as fund other Nouns related publishing projects.

Introduction
Comics have been an art form for over 100 years now, in many ways overtaking novels as the most important written form of creativity for society, and defining Intellectual Property more than Film or Television. Comics have the advantage of a monthly (in some cases) publishing cycle, are able to pump out more content than other mediums, and so are able to connect with a dedicated audience more frequently, as well as generating more stories than other mediums.

Comic Books have brought us Spider-man, Superman, Batman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Uncle Scrooge, Garfield, The Far Side, and quite literally tens of thousands more. Nouns is a visual creation, with much room for growth. The dedicated fanbase mimics that of core comic book publications of the past, giving the space and time to grow and be recognized by the worldwide community as a whole.

I have worked in the comic book industry for 25 years now, acting in various roles, but most notably as a publisher for various companies (Including Boom! Studios), as well as creating comics for properties such as Divinity: Original Sin 2, Transformers, Farscape, Warhammer, Warhammer 40K, Mickey Mouse, Frozen, Pixar, Pirates of the Caribbean, Spider-man, Thor, Star Wars, and many others.

In licensing, one is required to work within certain parameters, while creating a compelling product. This will serve me well when creating Nouns product, being able to listen to the community and create something appealing for the community, while also something that can be successful outside of it.

I have extensive knowledge of how to create compelling content and have a publishing and distribution agreement with Titan books (and through them Penguin Random House), so can focus on making this product physical in nature, and not just a digital offering, as well as something that will see Nouns splashed all over thousands of stores.

Utilize comics to generate constant content, keep the community engaged.
Develop stories, worlds, and characters that give more sandboxes for the community and other creatives within the community to play with.
Bring Nouns to the “Mass Market” (Comic book stores, book stores, big box stores, book clubs, libraries). Gives legitimacy to the IP, and expands the potential community.
Community Driven Support

Nouns is famously known for its treasury, often used to create interesting projects that further the Nouns ecosystem. What we are proposing is to engage and encourage the community to support the project, creating a financial model that isn’t solely dependent upon a treasury, and using that to expand the area and influence of NounsComics.

Much like Kickstarter, IndieGogo and Substack have used a model that allows early supporters to get exclusive items, while also funding projects that they have an interest in, and so too will NounsComics. The first engagement is to the Web3 community, as well as the Nouns community, offering access to exclusive comics, covers, and finally the ability to vote as a community on artists and authors, story beats, and covers.

The initial project will be a six issue comic book, along with a graphic novel release. NounsComics will pre-sell this series, in individual segments. The initial offerings will be:

Individual issues for sale, as well as the graphic novel (as a package)
A minimum order of 7,000 copies for sale, which will give an individual or community the chance to commission a special cover of the comic book, which will then be only available to them, to be distributed as they see fit (sold, given away, stored, etc.)
Sales of graded copies of the individual comics, to be graded and placed on the blockchain for them via an NFT once the book has been printed. The specific grade is out of 10, with 10 being absolutely perfect in every way (and is almost impossible to attain), so the grades will be at LEAST 9.6, with the final grade being between 9.6 – 10, randomized.

Individual comics are priced at $5.00 USD dynamic value
The Graphic novel is offered at $30.00 USD dynamic value
The graded comics will be offered for $250.00 USD dynamic value
Every purchase not only helps fund the project, but will also give the purchaser the right to vote on certain aspects of the comic book series. The individual things that can be voted on are :

The story concept and writer of the project. We will offer a minimum of 3 choices at the outset, prior to the project going on pre-sale. Each of these concepts and writers will be vetted, to ensure to plagiarism, as well as the ability to deliver a commercially viable product.

The art style and artist of the project. A minimum of 3 art styles and artists are made available for a range of options. Each of the artists will be vetted to make certain they are capable of delivering a product that will be entertaining, engaging and finally released on a timely basis! Two different styles for publishing are included below.

Which Nouns will be in the comic series. We will want to make sure that those that pre-purchase the series get to suggest and vote for various Nouns, with the top voted not only appearing in the comic series, but also having the Nouns owner engaged to create the voice and personality of the Noun appearing in the comic series.
For every single comics cover there will be at minimum 3 concept sketches provided, with votes choosing which one becomes the final cover. The same process will be used for the graphic novel.

All funds raised in this manner will be kept in a multi-sig wallet, with funds being released to move the project along, specific amounts for each portion of comic creation and issue.

So, a specific number will be released for the script to be completed for issue #1. After that is approved, a specific amount will be released for the layout of issue #1. After this, an amount will be released for the pencils to be finished for issue #1. Finally, the remaining sum allotted for issue #1 will be released for Colours and Letters of Issue #1. The same process will be repeated for Issues #2-6. In this manner we can keep progress moving in a timely manner, making sure that there are incentives to create the content quickly, but also doing as good a job as possible.

As the issues are completed, profits (if there are any) will be split in this manner : Payment of 25% of the profits to the publisher of the series. 25% of the profits to the NounsDAO Treasury itself. 40% will be held by NounsComics to keep the series running, and potentially fund new series down the road, and finally 10% to ComicsDAO, who will be onboarding the writers, artists and community members for votes and sales.

We use the community to fund and engage with the project
We pay back to the community with the success of the project
There are various onboarding points to the project that can make the community feel invested, choosing which Nouns appear, the feel and style of the project
As this project is printed, it will also be sold into comic book stores (and book stores in the case of the graphic novel). This can allow those not familiar with the Nouns community to see what it is capable of, and gives them a simple yet effective point to become engaged themselves. We have a publishing deal for both markets with major publishers, which is how we will accomplish this, NOT through independent publication.
Profit and Loss

Just some general calculations for the project :

If we assume a creative cost for the project of $210,000 USD for the six issue series (broken down as $35,000 USD per issue), we would need roughly 7,500 copies of each book sold to pay for printing and creative.

If we achieve 10,000 copies sold per issue, along with 200 copies sold of the physically graded comics, the financials would look like this :

Revenues : $675,000 USD
Expenses: $330,000 USD (this includes creative, printing and grading)
25% to NounsDAO : $86,250 USD
25% to Publisher : $86,250 USD
40% to NounsComics : $138,000 USD
10% to ComicsDAO : $34,500 USD
Financial Breakdown

Per issue Cost:
Pencils : $8,000 USD
Script : $3,000 USD
Inks : $3,000 USD
Colours : $5,000 USD

Multi-Signature Wallet

A wallet with signatures from DefaultedUser, JoshuaFisher and SharkDAO will be used to hold the funds that are released from NounsDAO, as well as sales from all books to individuals and communities. Sales from physical copies and stores will see the money placed in this wallet as well, after the expenses are removed by the Publisher (sales, printing, distribution, etc.)

All expenses will be itemized and available upon request online, to ensure that the wallet will contain the appropriate amount of money at all times.

25% profits to NounsDAO

The goal will be to make this a profitable endeavour in order to not just perpetuate published projects for the Nouns community, but to also generate revenues for the Nouns, in return for the initial support, concept generation, and paying back to the community. This will be achieved by placing 25% of the profits in a separate wallet, to be used to purchase Nouns. This will place the money back into the Treasury, and allow us to place additional publishing and content creation proposals ourselves, along with giving us a voice in our ability to vote on initiatives that we are supportive of.

Conclusion
With this approach, we can engage with the community, incentivize them to participate, and also grow the ecosystem beyond Web3. Until there is an easy onboarding process for the non-Web3 natives, Nouns cannot grow beyond this space. This might seem like an obstacle to overcome, but in fact, it is an asset. Most projects start from zero, with no supportive community to support it, and encourage others to participate.

We will leave with one story, that illustrates how dangerous no community is, and how it can make or break a project. A comics creator named Jeff Smith published a book series called Bone way back in 1991. At the time, it was one of the few black and white comics, didn’t have the monthly schedule that buyers liked, and was completely different from what was being published at the time. Jeff has commented repeatedly in later years that he nearly canceled the series numerous times within the first 10 issues. It was a very small community that supported his early works and allowed him to keep publishing (55 issues between 1991 and 2004). As the series continued on, it grew in fame and prestige, until in 2005 it was picked up by Scholastic books, and released through their new imprint. At this time it is one of the highest selling graphic novel series of all time, beating out all the superhero releases since the 1940’s to present day.

Without a supportive community, this project wouldn’t see the light of day, nor be given the space to continue and finally achieve the great success it deserves. The Nouns community can allow the same to happen with NounsComics, giving any project created a chance to grow and incubate until the world has a chance to enjoy it.

***Considering current ETH avg. price of 1,600 USD

**SUMMARY**
This will be a great opportunity to create a Nounish IRL experience which is spread across 4 days of activation at one of the largest most anticipated annual event in Singapore; an opportunity to have Nouns branding reach out to a wider audience. 

As COMEX is held on 1-4th Sep, this gives me a timeline of around 1 month. If proposal is able to pass and fund received within this week, majority of the funds will be converted to fiat as outlay for manufacturing Nounish goodies, remaining funds will be transfer to WEB3SG (ETH) as payment for the booth space at COMEX. I have already designed and created the files for the booth, thus I can pass them to WEB3SG who will manufacture and erect the booth. I will focus on overseeing the process as well as focusing on execution and administrative work prior to COMEX. 


**LONG TERM GOAL**
I will continue to grow Nouns Singapore community under @nounsinsg, with Nouns Booth as the initiate activation. Nounsinsg will serve as a proliferation pod, guidance and point of contact for new contributor as well as creating more IRL Nounish experience in the future. Similar to Aubtoshi, a personal long-term goal is to officially be a Nouner. Until then, I will continue to proliferate Nouns in ways that are fun and effective that I can make possible. A IRL activation that I've been working on would be ""NOUNISH BEACH CLEAN UP' which was passed and supported by SMALL GRANT. (Thank you @noun22) It is scheduled on 13th Aug 2022, you may find more info and update on the event below. 

I want to thank all Nouners in advance for giving me the chance to contribute and proliferate Nouns together! 

**Transactions**
Given the time sensitivity of this proposal, the transaction embedded will send 15 ETH to the Small Grants multi-sig.  If this proposal seems likely to pass in early voting, Small Grants will release the funds to the proposer a few days in advance of the proposal being queued and executed.",CANCELLED,15231913,15251623,0,38,,0,0,0,388,9,0,0,['15000000000000000000'],['0x2af21e37928613582734bcbaead0919801a4cacf'],[''],15218773,1658847392,0xeb942c138afcee8fd8f936ddb216aa307908337e6fae716312de6ee10cb5db7c,['0x'],0x75ee6eb3d8dacf41ee2e5307090b197d3e1cca6e

# tl;dr
Build a community to nounify Brazil ⌐◨-◨
 
# Description
 
NounsDAO Brazil seeks to introduce Nouns in the diverse cultural manifestations that provide identity and tell the story of our country. Therefore, we want to connect local artists and builders, aiming to create and proliferate Nouns, and collaborate with established Brazilian brands for merch collabs. It is also crucial to onboard those who might not be able to overcome language barriers by distributing content and organizing events in the native language, Portuguese. With that in mind, we are proposing Nouns Week, an event in four capital cities. Our web content can also reach people living in eight other countries besides Brazil. Over 260 million people (3.7% of the world's population) speak Portuguese, the fourth most used language after Mandarin, English, and Spanish.

# What have we done so far? (track record)

1. A contest on NounsDAO Brazil Twitter to nounify Brazilian symbols and memes, offering a prize to three winners. There were 23 submissions, great engagement and a lot of fun. 
![Winners](https://i.postimg.cc/4yXBpKcv/Cqr-Fl-Dd-Imgur.jpg)
2. Three proposals approved via Prop House:
- 100 nounish hoodies for homeless people
![Hoodies](https://i.postimg.cc/FsdD3QdB/cbn-Dz-Ml-Imgur.jpg)
- 20 Twitter covers for 20 nouns projects 
![Prop House cover](https://i.postimg.cc/hv98ZKLD/x-Nx-Nuvh-Imgur.jpg)
- Nouns OS as an entire Operating System Nouns-Themed for All Things Nouns
![Nouns OS](https://i.postimg.cc/zGdYdgFf/Nouns-OS-Desk-Blue-Sample.png)
3. In a month about 400 Twitter followers at NounsDAO Brazil account. 
4. In a week around 100 people are in NounsDAO Brazil discord.
 
# What do we want to do?

1. Nouns Week Brazil: guerrilla marketing actions to nounify four cities in different regions of the country, with a combined population of over 26 million people.
2. Community: maintain an active Twitter and Discord with an open conversation about new ideas and community needs.
3. NounsDAO grants: guide the Brazilian community on how to write and submit projects for small grants, prop house and nouns proposals. If necessary, we will help with Portuguese to English translation.
4. Noun heads contest: start an art contest on NounsDAO Brazil Twitter to create noun heads with Brazilian motives, offering 2 ETH prize split among 3 winners. 
5. Twitter spaces: regular Twitter spaces held in Portuguese to spread awareness, and special spaces in English to give this community access to guests that don't speak Portuguese. 
6. Website: create and launch NounsDAO Brazil website.
7. Merch collabs: contact well-established Brazilian brands like [Havaianas](https://havaianas.com.br/), [Melissa](https://www.melissa.com.br/), and [Hering](https://www.hering.com.br/) for a collaboration using noggles in the product's design.

# Nouns Week Brazil

We are planning a Nouns week in October 2022 with simultaneous nounification of four capital cities from north to south of Brazil. The cities are Fortaleza (2,68 million), Rio de Janeiro (6,7 million), São Paulo (12,33 million), and Porto Alegre (4,4 million). Local groups from NounsDAO Brazil will execute the project under the supervision of DAO's founders.
![Nouns week locations](https://i.postimg.cc/Jz9n0jwF/yk-DYco-L-Imgur.jpg)

We propose the following for Nouns Week Brazil:

1. Nouns graffiti in São Paulo: we are in talks with local graffiti artists to have noggles containing art done in a central location.
2. Nouns in digital billboard: promote Nouns and NounsDAO Brazil displaying a selection of Nouns during the Nouns Week, in all four cities mentioned above.
3. Floor ads with chalk: have the noggles sprayed on the streets of all four capital cities. Also, ask followers to tweet photos with specific hashtags and reward the ones with the most likes to foster engagement.
![Floorads](https://i.postimg.cc/4xtG8MM8/azb-Dgaa-Imgur.jpg)
4. Posters with Nouns and QR code: place posters with a QR code that will direct to nouns.wtf in all four cities.
![posters](https://i.postimg.cc/fT91ZdKy/De6g3-EN-Imgur.jpg)
5. Stickers: print nouns stickers to put all over the cities and give out to kids.
![stickers](https://i.postimg.cc/dQkJkL6P/Z2-Jun4x-Imgur.png)

Written by [Sasquatch](https://twitter.com/PartSasquatch) and [Maty](https://twitter.com/matyETH) 

### **Goal**

Proliferate Nouns through esports initiatives. Fuel the growth of a sub-community within the Nouns ecosystem.

### **Description**

Continuing the work of Prop #68, #91, and #112, this Esports Pod (comprised of esports-native Nouners and Nounsfolk) will function in a manner similar to the thriving small grants initiative within Nouns. It will use a delegated treasury to look for outsized opportunities within esports to continue proliferating Nouns with the best ROI possible. 

#### **Didn't we just pass an esports proposal?**
- All of our esports proposals so far have been game-specific.
- We have a very deep talent pool of esports native Nouners and Nounsfolk who can capably proliferate across a variety of titles.
- Having quick access to funds will allow for better proliferation, as the competitive landscape has an ever-evolving calendar that makes the formal proposal process slow. 
- The pod has already been pitched multiple proposal ideas from high-level esports operators.
    - Sending international players to the largest fighting game event.
    - Sponsoring a high-level Dota LAN.
    - Signing a League of Legends team.

### **Esports Pod**
- Consisting of Nouners and Nounsfok who are familiar with esports and aligned towards the mission of proliferation across the DAO. 
    - **Sasquatch** (Nouncil, Esports background)
    - **Brennen** (Nouner, Esports background)
    - **Maty** (Nouncil)
    - **Oni** (Nouner, Esports background)
    - **Brian Cho** (Nouner, Esports background)
    - **Jason Oliver** (Nouner, Esports background)
    - **Deeze** (Nouner, Esports background)
    - **thebeautyandthepunk** (Nouner) 
    - **Brax** (Esports background)
    - **PPD** (Esports background)
    - **Griff** (Esports background)

#### **Pod Structure** 
- The structure of the pod will be flexible, this means members can be added/removed based on a supermajority vote.
- Upon initial deployment, the pod will functionally operate inside of the Nouns Esports Discord server.
- Members of the Pod will vote over each proposed use of funds.
    - Any member can sponsor a proposal.
- A multi-sig consisting of Sasquatch, Brennen, Maty, Brian Cho, and Oni will operate funds.
- All use of funds will be documented in a manner transparent to the Nouns community.

### **Budget: 369 ETH**
- This budget will be governed by the members of the Esports Pod and controlled by a 3/5 multi-sig. 
    - Address: [0x8b45D1CACcb3593E9F1015BA8e97AFB68DE3a0d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b45D1CACcb3593E9F1015BA8e97AFB68DE3a0d1)
- For operational purposes, we will keep a portion of the standing budget as the stablecoin DAI.
- Distribution:
    - Proposals (~90%)
    - Operations (max 10%) -  We've already had a broad range of contributions, any compensation related to those efforts (outside of individual proposals) will have to be voted on internally and awarded retroactively.
        - Running weekly meetings, onboarding esports operators into Nouns, Discord & Twitter management, building the prop, multiple people taking calls and evaluating pitches, etc. 
        - May explore using Coordinape.
#### **Potential Use of Funds**
- Flexible funding towards infrastructure costs for each team we sign to Nouns Esports.
    - Bootcamps, logistics, special events. 
- Sponsoring additional players, streamers, or teams.
    - Each game is its own vertical to build within.
- Funding Projects:
    - Nouns Network
        - We see the talent network at Nouns to be one of the best features to leverage as we grow.  These projects may already be independently funded, we would have standing budget available to work with them in an esports capacity.
            - Examples:
                - Nouns Esports x [Nounish](https://twitter.com/nounish) (Prop 64) - Filming our players at events, advising on marketing strategy.
                - Nouns Esports x [Nouns Brand](https://twitter.com/nounsbrand) (Prop 109) - Designed outfits for the players at events, merch for fans.
                - Nouns Esports x [NOUNS ON THE GROUND](https://twitter.com/nounsotg) (Prop 110) - Sending the Proliferation Pod to events our teams compete in.
                - Supporting an Esports [Prop House](https://twitter.com/nounsprophouse).
    - Event Sponsorships
        - Outsized opportunities to have high brand exposure through streaming or physical events.
    - Streamers, Pros, or Casters with AR or Physical Noggles.
    - Creating gamer Noggles with blue light filter.
    - Creating team jerseys for players and fans.
- Forking Nouns to create an esports-specific subDAO
    - Designs created to represent games we participate in.
### **Future**
- Sustainability
    - We believe Nouns Esports inherently works to proliferate the Nouns brand, but we are still interested in exploring a path towards creating a self-sustaining sub-community. 
    - Pillars this could be built on:
        - Forking Nouns
            - Exploring a subDAO mechanic which allows for fans to engage with the team at a greater level than existing esports organizations.
        - Sponsors
            - Traditional web2 sponsors.
            - Web3 sponsors that the DAO chooses to affiliate with.
        - Nouns Esports in-game items

Given my background helping to build esports at Riot and then as a board director at Astralis, I’m a big believer that esports helps gamers turn their love for games into part of their broader identity. I’m excited to work with the Nouns esports team to proliferate the nouns brand to gamers through esports.

Nouns can be THE brand at the forefront of bringing wellness to young people worldwide in a playful, effective and engaging way.

Our Mission: To Proliferate the Nouns Brand by Helping Kids Globally Who Are Suffering Mentally After the Global Pandemic – Free of Charge.

We challenged ourselves to design an initiative that prioritized improving overall mental and physical wellbeing irrespective of school, workplace and home settings. An initiative that is comprehensive in nature, flexible in delivery, and aligned with specific wellbeing objectives that are drawn from global social and emotional wellness research. Combining our depth of experience in app development, education and content creation to deliver a remarkable outcome.

We have already created over 100 apps and wellness programs to great success, this will be our best of the best - an innovative, Noun branded mobile app for iOS and Android that will be an important support for kids when they need it most.

## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#what-are-you-proposing-3)What Are You Proposing?

NOUNS Wellness (name to be confirmed) is a mobile mental health app for the next generation. Using play and community spirit, kids are inspired and engaged with games and activities to actually practice mental health daily.

This proposal will cover details on how we can do this and why we are the team who can make this happen.

And also how this initiative is more than a good idea…

It’s potentially the very essence that makes NOUNS nounish. And what we see is a perfect match to the mission to not only proliferate the NOUNS brand, but also the NOUNS’ mission of goodwill.

LET’S GO!

## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#why-are-you-doing-it-4)Why Are You Doing It?

Mental health has never been more important post pandemic…

-   …And this time it’s the kids who are feeling the pressure, not just stressed out adults or Web3 degens. There are global stats that show some very alarming numbers with teen depression, anxiety and sadly suicides. There’s a lot to find wrong with the world, so activaley reminding, educating and inspiring young people has become integral to their wellbeing and their future.
    
-   Nouns Wellness will also have a natural ripple effect through our Web3 community. As part of the crypto culture, mental health is on everyone’s lips in Twitter Spaces and in Discord, but there has yet to be the wellness project to emerge and really connect with and serve the wider Web3 community.
    
-   Nouns is a project close to our hearts and we are aligned with what it represents. It excites us to see the diverse range of future collaborations and partnerships where we can proliferate the brand and its mission.
    

## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#why-nouns-5)Why Nouns?

Something that makes habits stick and fitness routines engaging is play and fun.

-   As pioneers in transforming fitness education with play at its center, we saw immediately how a playful and fun brand like Nouns can boost the wellness conversation with young people.
-   And at the same time boost the Nouns brand and positioning further, by activating real world engagement with Nouns and the super healthy benefits of a wellness practice.

In a word… Nouns will make wellness FUN. And Nouns are what wellness will look like for young kids. No-one is owning this wellness space for kids the way Nouns can.

(Plus as a Web3 native brand Nouns open the door to the conversation with young people about NFTs and what the blockchain means to our future.)

## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#how-is-this-different-to-whats-already-out-there-6)How Is This Different to What’s Already out There?

The go-to apps out there: Headspace, Calm and similar, are designed for adults.

They also only offer one type of mindfulness, (including ones for children) - guided experiences that are consumed in one direction. In our decades of experience with kids (and adults too) we have proven that interactive activities and playful tasks are game changers. Like moving your body with active play instead of reps on a gym mat.

This interactive approach is a major point of difference in the overall physical and mental wellbeing space. There are so many ways of doing wellbeing, but they’re not fun… Until NOUNS Wellness.

Additionally: The app source code we create will be open source and available for use by the Noun community.

## [](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-wellness-app-ios-android/1817#who-is-the-audience-how-are-you-going-to-market-this-app-7)Who Is the Audience? How Are You Going to Market This App?

As established business owners and leaders in the fitness, education and wellness space, we have an active database of 45,000+ teachers, schools, fitness professionals and educators who are actively trusting and consuming everything we create. A recommendation from us to this audience will activate thousands of teachers and schools as users.

Among these people we also have strong and reliable partnerships to further amplify reach and engagement beyond the Web3 universe. Offering free, engaging and ‘cool’ resources for kids’ wellbeing is something these communities are hungry for.

Additionally our wellness podcast features interviews with olympians, human potential leaders, international sports personalities and even actors: Energetic Radio by Dale Sidebottom with 260 episodes, weekly releases and thousands of monthly listeners. We are also both regular speakers and have been on stages in 40+ countries. We will promote the app to our engaged social media channels and activate webinar style campaigns, so NOUNS can leverage our existing network and following.

In short it’s not our first rodeo, we are not a startup like many projects in the Web3 space. We are seeing a synergy between our experience, our existing client base and the Noun brand to elevate both for greater impact – creating the foundations of the future world that Web3 stands for and ideas this project believes in.

We also aim to place Nouns at the forefront of supporting the Web3 community who are battling with extreme emotions of the daily game of NFT’s and Crypto.

Beyond this scope we believe Nouns could have wider appeal to the global issue of declining health and wellness. We see Nouns Wellness as contributing toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Number 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.

![](https://i.imgur.com/HhUV4YP.jpg)

# **TL;DR**
**PPT Studios is asking for $500K (~Ξ320 at the time of 07/28/22) to make one 11-minute episode of Nouns! An Animated Series. This show would be CC0.**

# **DESCRIPTION**
**We propose to create a pilot for *Nouns! An Animated Series*.** 
*Nouns! An Animated Pilot* is a 2D tradigital animated 11-minute episode as seen in the [Prop 70 (CC0 Pitchbook)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/70). The show is an animated comedy following the surreal adventures of best friends balancing the desire for mature adulthood and their reluctance to grow up.

# **We propose doing a pilot in 3 phases.**
**1) Script and Casting (weeks 1-6)** **$150K** 
*-1st milestone Deliver Script Tk01 Draft (End of Week 3)*
**2) Animatic (weeks 4-11) $200K** 
*-2nd milestone Deliver Storyboards (End of Week 9)*
**3) Final Animation (weeks 10-16) $150K** 

We are targeting the schedule for ~16 weeks. However, we may need some flexiblity and increase the time it takes to deliver the pilot to ensure we can put out the best product possible.
If we start at the beginning of August, we can deliver before the year end.

![](https://i.imgur.com/mKXuW47.jpg)

## **Phase 1: Scripting and Casting** 
This phase would last for four-six weeks.
During this phase we would work on the outline, script, script revisions and cast the episode.
Start Date: **08/01/22** 

## **Phase 2: Preproduction**
Starting week 4, we would begin Phase 2.
This phase would last seven weeks.
During this phase, we will thumbnail, and storyboard, refine character designs, and backgrounds, create digital puppets and record scratch tracks and audio.
Start Date: **08/22/22**

## **Phase 3: Production/ Post**
Starting week 10, we would begin Phase 3.
This phase is where the actual animation begins, with compositing, editing, and putting the final touches on everything.
Start Date: **10/03/22**

# **TOTAL ASK:**
**~Ξ320 or ($500K USD)** to fund the creation of Nouns! An Animated Pilot. 
*The ETH will be immediately converted to USDC to ensure we have funding to cover production costs.*

**MULTISIG**
The proposed budget + Ξ1 to cover gas fees will be released in ETH to a 3 of 4 multisig with signers **JoelCares**, **ToadyHawk**, **Benbodhi** and **thepencil.eth**. The ETH will be immediately converted to USDC, and everything in excess of the original budget, minus 1 ETH to cover gas for the life of the multisig, will be returned to the DAO. If, due to high volatility, insufficient ETH is available to cover the proposed budget, a second proposal will top up the multisig at a later date.

**Multisig address:**
0x3D2268fa80B76448A8b33d554A3E972f5d8d5534

**Phases to be funded at the commencement of each phase. Note that these are guidelines only and that a final determination will be made in collaboration with the person-place-thing-escrow multisig.*

The funds will go to pay for the following:

# **Q&A:**
Sam and Jason will make themselves available for Q&A in the Nouns Discord and on a Nouners call if needed.

**Q:** Why is this single episode $500K when the six episodes before came out to ~$333K each?
 
**A:** When amortizing costs across multiple episodes of a season, the overall cost per episode decreases. Artists' short-term freelance rates are higher than longer-term employment rates. There are also discounts on software subscriptions for longer-term commitments.

# **WHY IS THIS UNIQUE?**
In developing *Nouns! An Animated Series*, the mission of *Person Place Thing Studios* is to share, inspire, and empower people around the globe through CC0 storytelling.

As paid professionals in the animation space, we aim to modernize the animation studio and pipeline by no longer requiring industry talent to be tethered to an antiquated studio system, a specific geographic location, or a traditional network distribution model.

We plan to hire best-in-class artists and designers, make broadcast-quality Nounish content at an accelerated pace, and proliferate Nouns to a worldwide audience via the internet.

# **WHAT IS THE TONE OF THE SHOW?**
*Nouns! An Animated Series* draws from similar humor and animation quality as *The Regular Show* and *Adventure Time*.  We want to create shows that make us laugh!  Our cast of characters are goofballs!  They escalate simple situations into ridiculous adventures that are filled with unpredictable twists and turns. They rarely solve their problems but always end with a laugh!

# **WHY SHOULD WE BACK THIS?**
- Bringing Nouns to life through animation is the next leap in introducing these characters to the mainstream culture of all ages.
- Distributing on Youtube, Twitter, Tiktok, etc, allows Nouns to reach an enormous audience.
- Casting top talent as the voices of our characters will bring known celebrities to the world of Nouns and generate larger social media awareness and traditional media buzz.
- Developing episodes in the 11-minute format also opens the door to legacy media distribution.

# **BENEFITS TO THE DAO**
- We love the Nouns characters and are dying to see them come to life!
- Pilot episode will be CC0!
- Cartoons are a great source of memeonic content; our show will create many shareable clips that can help with the mission of proliferation.
- Cartoons are also a great invitation to a much wider and younger audience. 
- There will be new nounish content made and shared every day!
- Having an animated show will add value to other extensions in the Nouns ecosystem.
- Through Discord, the DAO will be an active participant in the creative process.
- Any profits obtained will be reinvested in the studio to make additional Nouns animated content.
- *Person Place Thing Studios* can be utilized in the creation of content for future DAO Proposals (episodic cartoons, commercial endeavors, music videos, shorts, etc)(i.e. The Greidiens pitch gets sold to a network, rather than having to shop around looking for a studio to work with we would already be set up to handle their needs.)
- As educators, we will be inviting and sending the CC0 assets to schools for their students to use as they learn animation while creating nounish content.

## Description

jokedao has built the first on-chain, bottom-up governance platform for communities to submit proposals and vote on their favorites; it enables community-set governance for user-generated roadmaps, grants, endorsements, bounties, curation, and contests.

One of the major benefits of on-chain voting is that it can allow for extensible contracts—that is, transactions that automatically execute depending on the results of a vote. For example, a community could vote on who to receive funds or what NFT to buy or even mint, and depending on the result of the vote, the transaction would be executed.

More excitingly, it also enables composable governance that could combine different transactions. For example, a community could vote on different features for an NFT, and the top three options could be combined to mint a unique image reflecting the different votes.

Extensible contracts would enable a whole new generation of projects in the Nouns ecosystem.

Some examples, please: how will this proliferate Nouns?

We imagine Nouns forks in the future won’t simply replicate Nouns but develop unique minting and auction mechanisms of their own to innovate on the Nouns playbook—not simply its art, but its model.

Here are a few examples of Nouns forks that jokedao could enable through extensible contracts:

Create-a-Noun. Communities could submit and vote on the different properties of a Nouns that could then be automatically generated to incorporate each of the individual qualities.

User-generated Nouns. Enable NFT-derived voting power so that communities could create interactive Nouns projects in which the holders of NFTs could collectively submit and vote on the design of each subsequent NFT.

Nouns governance giveaways. Every 10th Noun (derivative) could be given away to a member of the community who had voted on the most winning options in the previous 9 contests, in order to incentivize voting and reward those who build social consensus with a community to vote on winning options.

Nouns governance rewards. Rewards (NFTs, Poaps, tokens, portions of the treasury, etc.) could be given away to those who have voted consistently in Nouns proposals in order to incentivize active participation.

On-chain Nouns Grants. jokedao could collaborate with Prop House to enable fully on-chain and open-source grants for communities to use to incentivize builders to develop their NFT universe.

## Context

jokedao started as a Nouns fork through its proof-of-concept, the jokerace—a weekly contest in which the community of $JOKE holders votes on the 2nd best joke of the week, which is minted as an NFT that’s sold on a recurring basis. It is likely the first case in which an NFT collection was fully community-created. Since launching in the spring, the jokerace has regularly drawn around 100 weekly players who return each week, consistently sold NFTs, and incentivized the creation of teams that compete. In other words, as a DAO, it’s organically incentivized the creation of subDAOs without input or management from the core team.

Since then, jokedao has built a platform with scaffold eth for creating and running contests by minting voting tokens and sharing them with communities. Currently 8 EVM-compatible chains are supported so communities can deploy contests and voting tokens on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, etc. We are relaunching with clean, beautiful UI in a few weeks.

Projects like MetricsDAO and Backdrop already use jokedao for contests with their community, and jokedao has soft commits from about another dozen projects in the space to use it for governance after the site relaunch—many of these are NFT projects looking to give their communities more ways to collectively create NFTs themselves. Other popular use cases include grants, giveaways, and content creators letting their communities tell them what kind of content to create.

Finally, let’s emphasize that neither bottom-up nor on-chain governance have been unlocked in NFTs or DAOs to date. Projects typically give few avenues for their communities to express their ideas or cocreate beyond approving proposals of a core team. And on-chain governance has been prohibitive due to gas fees until the past few months.

Both of these unlock exciting opportunities for DAOs and NFT projects to create far more inclusive and incentivized communities—as we’ve seen with both Nouns and the jokerace.

## Why?

Nouns is unique among NFT projects for a number of reasons—but perhaps most of all that it’s the only NFT project with the means and model to incentivize builders to develop its ecosystem’s value through forks, homages, expansion packs, and next-generation projects. No other NFT project has this.

Jokedao’s thesis is that the next wave of NFTs and DAOs will be far more interactive and community-governed than this last wave—which has primarily seen centralized figures appealing to consumers to support them, rather than to actively cocreate. Nouns has shown the strongest evidence of this trend, and it seems clear that the next generation of NFT DAOs will go further in letting their communities compete, team up, and create as fun forms of gamified governance. Nouns is in the best position to support these projects within its own ecosystem to grow its value, and jokedao would love to team up to make it happen.

## Deliverables

Extensible contract module: enabling contests to automatically execute transactions depending on the result of a vote
Creator submission control: enabling only contest creators to submit options for a community to choose from (avoiding user-generated code that may have issues)
Composable contracts: enabling different winning votes to be combined, for example to combine different properties of a Nouns into a new NFT

Prop 56 was funded for 55 ETH (165K) to make 5K FUN Frames:
 
Price Breakdown was: 
Pre-Production – ~50K 
Production – ~80K 
Shipping – 15K 
Warehousing for 1 year – 12K 
Liability Insurance for 1 year – 9K 
 
Klim/Bigshot Toyworks received 5ETH on 4/13/22 (3,029 ETH) and 15 ETH on 4/27/22(2,800 ETH) for pre-production and tooling costs. The remaining ETH was held in a Gnosis until samples were delivered and the tooling was complete. 
 
Early May they cashed out: 
5E at ~$3,029 (4/17) = 15,145 
5E at ~$2,930 = 14,650 
10 at ~$2,450 = 24,200 
Total = ~53,995 USDC (would have been 57,000 if cashed out right way) 
 
After this, while the funds were in the Gnosis the price of ETH dropped significantly and we began discussing what we should do for creators needing USD to complete projects moving forward. We saw an example with Prop 73 where the funds were converted to USDC. We landed on this being a good path forward.  We continued to discuss balances needed to complete projects before this precedent was set. 
 
For Klim the remaining ETH was held in a Gnosis Safe while tooling was completed and samples were made. He delivered his product on time as promised. He incurred additional expenses for rush fees and shipping on samples that were sent to Austin & NYC. He is now ready for production but the funds are short. 
 
While tooling was being created and the price of ETH dropped significantly I was not comfortable making any decisions with the DAO’s funds independently. I began having multiple conversations within the DAO to discuss how to finish this Prop and the best path forward.  It seemed that converting the balance in the Gnosis to USDC was the best move while we figured out how to treat the remaining funds needed to complete the Prop.  On July 8th I made a Swap for the remaining 35ETH to USDC and sent 42,163 USDC to Klim.  
 
The total needed to finish this project is $116,000 of which Klim has $42,000. He needs an additional $74,000 (~50ETH on 7/28/22) and deliver:

**tl;dr:**
> Request to fund a second mandated round for 100 ETH to fund 5 teams @ 20 ETH each with the mandate to build alternative Nouns Governance clients.

# Summary

Given the success of our first mandated round, let's keep momentum up and kick-off a second mandated round for Nouns governance clients. For folks who missed it: an overview of the Nouns Client round:

- [35 proposals](https://prop.house/nouns-mandates) from top caliber builders
- 1416 votes casted (a record for Prop House)
- [4 teams funded](https://twitter.com/nounsprophouse/status/1551692309116379137)
- A record breaking % of highly desirable proposals
- Noun-pilled top quality folks

This time around, we’d be inviting builders to propose ideas for alternative Nouns Governance clients. While our classic [nouns.wtf/vote](https://nouns.wtf/vote) gets the job done, there is a lot more to explore regarding Nouns governance. This might take several directions:

- Delegation marketplace
- Better info curation to make more informed decisions
- New voting / dicussions mechanisms for Nouners to better signal prior to going on-chain
- Post-funding trackers

> Recommended reading to get creative juices flowing: [Discussion: Request for Nounish Governance Experiments](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/discussion-request-for-nounish-governance-experiments/1859)

The thing to note is that there are good ideas outside of the community and highly competent builders ready to execute on them. Prop House mandated rounds are a way to not only build up the Nouns ecosystem but also onboard top-notch builders as well.

# Scope

The mandate would be around Nouns Governance. Any proposal to build a client that improves Nouns Governance in a meaningul way is welcome.

The round will be hosted in the [Nouns Mandates house](https://prop.house/nouns-mandates) with two weeks proposal time and one week for voting by nouners.

# Safe

John Hamon X Nouns
## TL;DR
A collaboration between France’s ubiquitous street artist’s face and Nouns.

[link to discourse: https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/john-hamon-x-nouns/1731]

![Artist Mockups](https://www.jiji-studio.com/assets/JohnHamon.png)
## WHO IS JOHN HAMON
John Hamon is the name and, well, nobody really knows much more than that. His face appears on posters all over Paris and has been since 2001. Often found next to Invader or M. CHAT, John is a mystery and a joke in the art world. His motto is 'It is the promotion that makes the artist or the zero degree of art.' Recently, John has shown a lot of interest developing ideas around AR and Metaverse/NFTs. He has reached out to Coralorca after a Twitter follow, and they talked about doing some nounish things together, starting with a noggles campaign.   
## VALUE PROPOSITION
It is interesting for NounsDAO to position themselves along something mysterious that comes from the streets, from the art world, and support artists while doing so. People will notice the glasses and wonder what it all means, it will trigger their imagination and curiosity. On top of that, France has a strong Web3 community that will surely notice. 
## SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
A total of 1000 wheat posters and John will change his PFP on twitter and instagram during the campaign. 
500 posters 70*100cm in Paris, with 10 of them in a circular “profile picture” 100cm*100cm format.
250 posters 70*100cm in Marseille, with 10 of them in a circular “profile picture” 100cm*100cm format.
250 70*100cm in Lyon, with 10 of them in a circular “profile picture” 100cm*100cm format.
+ a bonus projection on the BNF (National French Library) similar to picture below
![Artist Projection Mockup](https://www.jiji-studio.com/assets/JohnHamonBNF.png)
John will make sure this is well documented with short movies and pictures. I also have contacts in Paris if we need additional videos.
Some quick mockups by the artist:
![Artist Mockups](https://www.jiji-studio.com/assets/JohnHamonMockups.png)
Regarding legality: the posters will be placed on tolerated areas like construction sites, public poster boards etc And the circular ones will be placed where there are already a few invaders and other street artists, where it is tolerated.
Coral Orca will organize a street marketing campaign next to the posters with chalk stencils. We decided to have the noggles in different colors as well and not show any website url - keep it mysterious for now. 
John will also post on his instagram account about the campaign and modify his profile picture to add the nouns glasses.

127,Nouns x Dopamine,"# Nouns x Dopamine

tl:dr: Dopamine & Apenoun propose to collaborate on a limited-supply Nounish non-fungible streetwear drop to be released at the Dopamine product launch event at Art Basel Miami in December. Funds requested are ~62Ξ - 82Ξ, with 85% of the primary sales revenue going to the Nouns treasury.


![dopamine1|690x388](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fcb654ffb-1fbf-439e-9acd-16fed749523b%2FIMG_01.jpg?table=block&id=4d66b37a-86ae-48a7-adc2-6c620f477466&spaceId=ba19d8ff-64a6-48a3-b1b8-4d690f10f95f&width=2000&userId=f55ed8db-e5a2-4f22-a7b5-744d0899742f&cache=v2)


[Dopamine](http://dopamine.xyz/) is a Nouns-fork with the mission to empower empower Web3 projects, NFT artists, and collectors through the world’s first community-owned ecosystem for non-fungible streetwear. We are homegrown web3 natives aiming to bridge the gap between streetwear & crypto culture.

Inspired by Nouns DAO, our membership structure has a Nounish distribution, and we’ll be kicking off our auctions later this year. Holders of Dopamine Membership NFTs determine the creative direction of Dopamine, in addition to revenue sharing and perks at our IRL events.

As a streetwear-focused web3 project our goal is to bridge the divide between the physical and digital worlds. Though we recognise the growing market for digital-only fashion, as Hypebeasts who tend to spend [an insane amount of money](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/streetwear-supreme-fans-spending-habits/) on streetwear and [sneakers](https://stockx.com/news/sneakerheads-spend-10-of-income-on-kicks/#), we love our physical pieces and really couldn’t live without them.

In contrast to a project like RTFKT for example we are physical-first, meaning that upon physical delivery of our garments, customers must scan a microchip to authenticate ownership, after which they will receive the bundled NFTs.

It’s undeniable that NFTs have unleashed a new cultural revolution, putting the creative power in the hands of digital artists, musicians, and photographers, and creating an exploding market for digital collectibles. This is the energy we want to bring to streetwear.

So we’re taking the best of both worlds as physicals take us off our screens and bring us together through something tactile, while NFTs unlock a new world with limitless creative possibilities.

The Dopamine Team is thrilled to collaborate with Apenoun to design a limited-supply Nouns-inspired non-fungible streetwear bundle for the Dopamine Marketplace launch at Art Basel Miami. With this collab we hope to push the Nounish culture forward and proliferate the Nouns meme and brand across the Metaverse and into mainstream pop culture.


## **Non-Fungible Streetwear Bundles**

The main product Dopamine offers partners are limited-edition “non-fungible streetwear bundles” consisting of these parts:

- The physical streetwear piece embedded with the Dopamine microchip.
- The “physical-bound NFT” (PNFT), a digital 3D model of the piece, forever cryptographically bound to the microchip.
- “Accessory NFTs”, which could include digital art, represent brand loyalty or event perks, or any other creative expression partners wish to include in the bundle.

## **Dopamine Studio Curation**

Dopamine Studio is the one-stop shop for brands and creators to create Non-Fungible Streetwear either from scratch or by bundling their already existing merchandise. 

This product is intended to be released nearing Q1, providing a Manifold-like experience to end-to-end collection curation made specially for streetwear. Before that, Dopamine will offer this service to partners on a case-by-case consultancy basis, with Nouns as one of the first partners.

![dopamine3|690x388](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F0d708d0b-ab63-4ec1-a265-78ae6af0aab3%2F4_4.png?table=block&id=9d06c861-10a8-45a4-8f5b-2dc45e2e8a98&spaceId=ba19d8ff-64a6-48a3-b1b8-4d690f10f95f&width=2000&userId=f55ed8db-e5a2-4f22-a7b5-744d0899742f&cache=v2)

## **Supported Customizations**

- 3D PNFT Design
    - The media file for the PNFT (that which is directly bound to the garment through our Microchip) will feature a 3D rendition of the physical garment.
- Accessory NFT Designs / Media Uploads
    - Each Non-Fungible Streetwear Piece may be bundled with additional accessory media files bundled as NFTs. These can be alternative skins, complementary music files, avatars, etc.
- Collection-specific Specs
    - These will include royalties, distribution strategies (e.g. fixed-price sale vs. DAs), NFT types, etc.

Dopamine will work closely with Apenoun to create a fully on-brand Nouns Streetwear Bundle, with specifications that fit with the Nouns ethos.

## **Dopamine Microchips**

Dopamine microchips are two-sided, 27mm round, 1mm thick NFC chips with silver foliage. For information on scanning through the Dopamine Scanner.

The Dopamine Scanner is a browser-based scanner for minting and linking Non-Fungible Streetwear to their associated PNFTs (and by virtue of that any other bundled NFTs), as well as verifying and authenticating the owner, manufacturer, and collection owner of the streetwear pieces.

![](https://i.imgur.com/bDOjQBh.gif)


[The Noun Square](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock) is a daily Twitter Spaces ritual celebrating Noun O' Clock (NOC) in a fun and engaging format. Spearheaded by [Toady Hawk](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk), [Ser Noadz](https://twitter.com/thenoadz) and [Noun 142](https://twitter.com/1fortytwo), administered by a talented committee of Nounish builders, and supported by a growing international community.

After a two week unpaid experiment, plus a one month funded trial ([Prop 101](https://nouns.wtf/vote/101)), we believe we have proven our worth to the Nouns ecosystem, both as a daily touchpoint for the community, and as a powerful onboarding tool for Nouns-curious passers-by the world over. We are requesting funding to continue running and growing the show for the remainder of the 2022 calendar year.

## Accomplishments
* **58 Consecutive Daily Spaces**, none missed. 
* **A 24-hour Twitter Space** for the nouniverse with over 60 Nounish guests and 1,400+ attendees from all over the world (attendance never dropped below 100 unique listeners all night and day.)
* **3 successful Coordinape Rounds** completed, awarding USDC to a total of 12 unique contributing members. Pioneering completely decentralized rewards-based compensation based loosely on Nouncil model. **Average compensation per contributor $1,500 USDC per round.**   
* **120 Daily Attendees on average**, with some shows as high as 400.
* **Surpassed our metrics** for the entire one month trial in just 2 weeks, and have now in some cases doubled expectations.

### Our Actual Metrics to Date:

* 1.2M Tweet Impressions(!!) (More than 2X of goal)
* 1,750 Followers (1.5X goal)
* Average attendance: 120 per day 
* FOMO players: average 50 per day
* 1,650 Contest Entries (2X of goal)

## Amazing Nounish Content

### Engaging Contests
* **6 weeks+ of consecutive contests**: awarded over 11 ETH in prizes to creative and talented Nounsfolk. Contests have resulted in over 1,650 unique pieces of user-created Nounish art/content so far, and has spawned at least 3 individual Nounish art collections.

[![nounish-cloud.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/N0Zrqbzh/nounish-cloud.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/R3Q0w1mG)

* Among the winning entries of these contests have been some truly incredible pieces of art, including this Watercolor Cloud Noun by [Jheeart_NFT](https://twitter.com/jheeart_nft). 
    * We helped this artist to create a collection ""With Noun"" using Manifold, and release the piece as an NFT (which sold for 0.69!) and she is releasing more pieces in the same style, [you can see the collection here.](https://opensea.io/collection/withnoun)  
* **Our show has become an efficient marketing tool** to discover and recruit new artists & builders for Nouns DAO. With contests we are able to identify top talent and funnel it to Small Grants or Prop House to onboard to building for Nouns!

### Awesome Guests

DeezeFi (twice), David Horvath, Taco Noun, Salvino, Oni, Messhup, Brennen, Grammy-winning Musician Violetta Zironi (who performed live), Stoopid Buddy, Jack Butcher and more.

### A Platform for Builders

We provide a live and engaged audience for builders to update the audience on the progress of their projects. This is a very effective way for builders to get attention to their work.

### FOMO Engagement: Just Look At Those Nouns
Through increased FOMO engagement, we have helped mint some truly beautiful Nouns (including an incredible triple Void run!)

[![sexy-nouns.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/TPyq8KQs/sexy-nouns.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/CZgfkL3C)

### Using POAPs to Gamify Participation and Give a Platform to Artists

We have given a daily POAP to attendees of The Noun Square every day since our inception. This is the purest use case for the protocol, and works well for us to incentivize people to attend our Twitter spaces, play FOMO live and participate in our contests. 

Additionally, this has allowed us to feature the art of talented established artists like Ser Noadz, Sam Ellis, SuperTightWoody and Greta Grempllin, as well as giving exposure to talented new creators like [0xAprilia](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock/status/1555013482222870528?s=20&t=l1iqwV_VBZS7cDVu0b6HNw), [Illustradora.eth](https://twitter.com/ilustradoraeth/status/1556418817244422144?s=20&t=l1iqwV_VBZS7cDVu0b6HNw) and [Leetlestar](https://twitter.com/hapsigmi/status/1556802875111550976?s=20&t=l1iqwV_VBZS7cDVu0b6HNw). 

We also plan to continue to use the data from these POAP distributions in the future to do token-gated raffles and contests that reward past participants and strengthen our community.

## Bonus Things We've Done That We Didn't Even Say We'd Do

* **24-hour Nouniversary Celebration**: an audacious [Twitter Space](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock/status/1556348069662412802) on the Nouniversary with dozens of guests booked, contests, games and more. 
    * Over 1,400+ unique attendees, attendance never dropped below 100 at any time.
    * 50+ Nounish guests
    * Amazing community shared moments.
* **Nounish NFT collections:** We have helped community members to set up Nounish NFT collections based on their Noun Square contest entries using Manifold. 
* **International outreach:** We have done outreach to international audiences by hosting non-English Spaces on some Saturdays, and making foreign-language channels in Discord with moderation.
* **Community involvement in DAO governance:** Noun 142 Delegated his Noun to The Noun Square multisig so that we could initiate an Audience Voting initiative. 
    * We invite proposers to pitch their proposals to the audience.
    * The audience then votes live in our discord.
    * We then execute the voted on-chain accordingly. 
    * This has been a popular segment, and we look forward to expanding on the experiment in future.


## The Future of the Noun Square
We hope the above sections paint a clear picture of all the accomplishments our team has achieved over the past 6 weeks, meeting or exceeding all the engagement goals we set for ourselves in Prop 101. 

The Purpose of this Proposal is to ask the DAO to fund our proven team for an additional 5 months, until the end of the calendar year, to do the following:

* **Continue to plan and execute daily Twitter Spaces**: Engage newcomers, Nouners and Nouns community members alike, with informative guests and fun contests that produce a plethora of Nouns-based art and authentic social media engagement.
* **Continue to organize Contests for our community**: Using data from our trial, we have found that 1-2 weekly contests with larger prizes are both more effective and less administratively onerous compared to daily contests. We would plan to move forward with 1-2 contests per week with prizes ranging from 0.05-1ETH, which will no doubt encourage more thoughtful and skillful entries (while also peppering in smaller contests live on the show for variety.)  
* **Innovate on contest voting and prize administration:** We have spoken with Nounder Seneca and, if funded, plan to move forward with an implementation of **Prop House** for our contest entries to be voted on weekly, as an alternative to the current system of emoji voting in Discord. 
* **Work with the [Noun O'Clock Web App](https://prop.house/proposal/777) team:** Iterate with the team to ship a product with product-market fit and integrate these clients with our own site and daily Spaces as much as possible. 

### Areas of Focus

Our vision for TNS in the next 5 months:

* **International growth:** As we enter a European/APAC friendly Noun O Clock, we want to seize the opportunity to introduce Nouns to these regions of the world even more than we already have been.
* **Be a leading onboarding funnel to Nouns:** We have seen initial signs that our show is a great vehicle to onboard artists, builders, and future Nouners to the DAO. We want to lean into this and make sure our show becomes a strong funnel into nouns.
* **Expand to new channels:** We want to explore growth opportunities via new channels like podcast platforms, Youtube, TikTok and Twitch.
* **The Noun Square as a platform for builders:** We want to keep attracting talent to build on top of our show. Two teams ([NOC nouns client](https://prop.house/proposal/777) & [NOC Onboarding Materials](https://prop.house/proposal/864)) have already won prop house funding to build specifically on top of the Noun Square show, in addition to the previously mentioned artists whose collections have been prompted by our contests, and we hope to see more in the coming months.

### So what does success look like at the end of 2022?
* Grow our twitter followers from 1,600 to 5,000+
* Average daily attendance by end of year 200+
* 5,000+ contest entries
* International growth: Our goal is to contribute to growing a much larger international noun ecosystem by end of year. We have already started this outreach and plan to continue with more foreign language ""takeover"" spaces on the weekends, and focus on non-English accessibility in Discord and Twitter.  


### Budget

Monthly Operations Costs: 
* **Contest Prizes:** 10 ETH
* **Team Compensation and Administration:** 50 ETH per month, allocated by Committee Coordinape on a Biweekly basis.
* **Time Period:** 5 months until end of 2022. 
* 5 x 60 ETH = 300 ETH
**Total Proposal Ask: 300 ETH**
(Cost of 3 Daily Nouns Auctions for 5 months of daily Nounish multimedia content and organic social media engagement.) 


### Team

We will continue with our ""3C Model"" of governance and accountability:

**Core (Founding) Team (Responsible for Execution):**

Toady Hawk
Noun 142
Ser Noadz

**Council (Responsible for Decisions and Daily Direction)**

Aubtoshi
Benbodhi
SuperTightWoody
RyanMac21
!Xargs
Sam Ellis
Maty.eth
Joshua Fisher


*Members of this committee may rotate depending on timezones, availability, etc. New incoming Committee members from APAC timezones will most probably include 0xigami, Goldy, Mr. Boney, Mintfaced, and more.*

### Community (Talent Funnel for Council)

Anyone in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/VQxv2BFw39) and Twitter communities can join and participate in all our public channels to help with contest ideas, guest ideas, and more, and can apply to join the Organizing Committee at any time. We have forked Nouncil governance with procedures for adding/removing contributing committee members at any time. 

The above organizational strategy (modeled loosely on Nouncil) allows us enough structure to execute on a daily basis, as well as enough flexibility to adapt to new timezones and other challenges as they may arise.


## Strategy for North American ""Nouns Winter""

NOC happening during North American late night/early morning may have some impact on our attendance rate, although we have been attracting a sizable audience from Europe and Asia already (for example, during our recent 24H long Nouniversary Spaces, attendance never dropped below 100 even during NA non-peak hours.) Nonetheless, we think of this as an opportunity rather than a challenge: 

### Proliferation opportunity
* Auction times drifting enable fairer distribution of nouns across the globe. **We think of our show drifting with NOC as giving a fairer opportunity for Noun proliferation outside of the Americas timezones**
*  We will have the opportunity to **engage with international guests**, and introduce our nounish energy to a new audience. 

### Host Recruiting & Scaling Ops

* **We have begun recruiting additional hosts** and administrative helpers from Europe and APAC timezones so that we can smoothly transition into North American night.
* Several of our Committee members are also excited to continue hosting/attending the show well into the North American night. 
* We are **already pulling in an impressive daily audience from Europe, Australia and Asia** (especially Japan and Korea.) 
* We plan to work with members of NounsDAOJapan, NounsDAO Brazil and GnarsDAO (Australia based) to continue to pull in new viewers and new Nounsfolk even through the North American early morning hours.



### New distribution channels

* We will begin posting recordings of our daily spaces both on a **podcast server and on Youtube**, so that North American audiences will still be able to listen and interact with our content daily. 
* We will also experiment with doing trial versions of The Noun Square on **Youtube, Twitch, and TikTok Live** to test engagement on those mediums. 

### Scaling with systems
* Our team has created a robust Notion for knowledge management with **Planning Documents, Tracking Databases and Daily Run-of-Show Templates** to enable onboarding of new hosts and contributors as easy and decentralized as possible.


## LFG!

We were funded for a trial and have surpassed all goals and metrics by a large margin, going above and beyond with initiatives such as the 24 hour Nouniversary Spaces. 

We represent a group of committed Nounish builders with a good track record of success, and we are asking for the DAO's trust, as we lean into a very successful concept and continue to improve, grow and scale this new platform centred around the daily Noun O' Clock. 

We believe that in a short time, The Noun Square has become the defacto watercooler of the Nounish ecosystem, as well as an impressive funnel for new Noun owners, artists and builders. 

We are excited by how much more we can do if given a mandate to keep on building throughout the remainder of 2022.

*This is 0xBobatea, I'm submitting this proposal on behalf of my friends at Advisry:

We want to Nounify New York Fashion week! By branding and collaborating on Advisry’s official calendar runway show in September, we will introduce nouns to fashion in an illustrious way.

**Why?**

Nouns has effortlessly aligned itself with all realms of high art. As a young fashion label, we are aware of the shift in culture and believe the Nouns Glasses logo is the Nike swoosh of web3. We feel it is necessary for Nouns to be represented in the most iconic facet of fashion culture, the fashion runway show.

**Nouns x Advisry Experience**

What Nouns is working towards in the future of web3 aligns closely with the overall goals of Advisry. Advisry and Nouns both strive to build communities to give individuals a voice and platform to express themselves and their ideas on a bigger scale. 

The Advisry X Nouns experience involves “In Real Life” events that bring our conglomerates together to communicate the importance of unity and change. Advisry wants to involve web3 in fashion and continue aligning with Nouns on potential future projects. 

**How**

To Nounify the show and after party, we will:

- Provide Advisry X Nouns POAPs to onboard show guests.
- Provide Nouns gifts for every show guest.
- Brand Nouns EVERYWHERE at the venue for the show and after party.
- Include Nouns pieces & looks designed by Keith Herron on the runway.
- Film a documentary of the process of Nounifying NYFW.

**The Show**

In September Advisry will be showing their first womenswear collection at New York Fashion Week. The collection titled, “Masculin Feminin” aims to capture gender inclusivity through 32 looks of traditional and nontraditional womenswear. 

**Nouns On The Runway**

Advisry will include Nouns Sunglasses that will be featured in one of the looks in the runway show. Along with this, one of the models will graze the runway with the Nouns Soft Trunk. There will be two Nouns-themed looks in the show.

![nouns soft trunk.png](https://polished-walrus-b42.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F3f9c2296-0f88-4cad-9653-e37319381ee3%2Fnouns_soft_trunk.png?table=block&id=30217e74-922a-4901-9f78-9c2fe4257837&spaceId=aaa84961-448d-41f3-9787-b37867da72d8&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)

**THE NOUNS SOFT TRUNK**

The soft trunk design is a reference and ode to custom Goyard and Gucci trunks made for their premier clients. They Screenprint their client’s names and or logos on the baggage to make them custom. The more thoughtful side of the design is the altering of the trunk itself - changing it from wooden frame structure to a more soft leather structure, similar to a luxury duffle. This trunk design is intended to be immediately iconic due to the pure crossover of a nouns logo with Advisry’s monogram print.

- A classical trunk shape & hardware, but no wooden frame - it will be made of vegan leather with gold plated .925 silver hardware - structured so it will maintain shape
- The classic Advisry checkerboard monogram will be embossed into the leather - the nouns glasses will be screenprinted on the bag
- Made in Italy

**Venue**

The show will take place in the *Oculus NYC*, an artistic landmark located at The World Trade Center. We will be the first of many fashion brands to utilize this as a show space, which is on its way to becoming one of the new homes of New York Fashion Week.

The Oculus NYC is located in one of the most heavily foot trafficked areas in all of New York. The building is packed with many storefronts, an NJTransit & major MTA station hub, and was once even home to a Kanye West music video in 2019.

**Set Production**

- Dress the runway with Parisian style cafe chairs and tables where guests will be seated
- Light the show with Parisian style street lamps that are manually operated to highlight models by turning on and off as they walk the runway

**Proposal**

**Fund Advisry to:**

- Occupy the Oculus NYC space for the show and after party
- Produce all garments and accessories for the show
- Execute the set design of the show
- Create collaborative pieces to seed and sell to Nouns new and growing audience of luxury consumers
- Build out a team to produce, fabricate, style, cast, and model the *Masculin Feminin* Show
- Brand Nouns throughout the venue using Vinyl, Signage, Video, and more

**Branding**.

- Nouns X Advisry T-shirt collaboration to be gifted and/or sold at the after party
- Nouns branded drinks at the after party
- Nouns signage and video being played throughout the venue
- Nouns branding on all invites and Ads posted by Advisry

**Billboard: a 60’ x 12’ Nouns billboard placed outside of the Oculus, designed by Advisry’s creative director, Keith Herron. This billboard will reach beyond our fashion week audience and be seen by the heavy traffic of tourists and locals walking through the historic Oculus Space.**  

According to the City of New York data last updated on June 30 2022, the Oculus has an average foot traffic of 16,000 people per day

**Documentation**

We want to create a documentary that captures behind the scenes footage of the Nounification of New York Fashion Week! 

Telling the story of how an IRL fashion show can be realized with a Nouns collaboration speaks to how valuable, versatile, and functional the DAO is. The documentary would be the first of its kind and a timeless piece in a world where web3 and the high arts will one day seamlessly grow and work together. 

We would work to publish this documentary on a fashion youtube channel like Vogue, GQ, Etc. 

*We are interested in working with the creators of **Prop 73, Stoopid Buddy Doc** to film and produce the documentary but have not yet been in contact with them.* 

**How does this benefit Nouns**

New York Fashion Week is one of the most iconic and respected events in the global fashion industry. By working side by side we will transform the view of Nouns as not only having a “luxury” side of the brand with sunglasses and high quality garments, but also having a leg in the always changing industry of fashion.

Nouns holders in NYC will have the opportunity to place their name on our guest list for the runway show and all after parties using an alias to keep identities private.

A multi-faceted branding opportunity that not only reaches the show audience but also the city of New York

**Visibility**

With past coverage from Vogue, GQ, Forbes, WWD, CFDA, and more we believe we can bring Nouns to the forefront of fashion journalism. 

These platforms will put Nouns on hundreds of thousands of peoples radar if not more. Vogue, GQ, and WWD alone average over 5 to 10 million monthly website viewers and have a combined following of over 100 million people on all of their social media platforms.

**Why work with Advisry?**

Advisry is a fashion, film, and music label based in NYC. Keith Herron, 22 year old founder and designer, began Advisry when he was in 8th grade and has been growing the brand ever since. Keith has sold Advisry to 35 different countries, was awarded the Gucci Changemakers scholarship and was most recently added to the Designer’s Hub of CFDA: a members-only incubator of American Designers joining the likes of Marc Jacobs, Rick Owens, Virgil Abloh, and many more.

Last spring Advisry debuted on the runway at NYFW. In his first live show, Keith designed 37 looks and packed out the venue with over 150 people in attendance. 

The fashion industry is very gate kept. There is no actual way to break through the industry in an official way without working with a brand that has already broken through. Historically, the way brands get the opportunity to be on the official fashion calendar is by spending many seasons producing their own runway shows independent of the fashion calendar, hoping to gain the attention of the CFDA. 

The benefit of collaborating with Advisry is it gives Nouns an authentic introduction and inclusion into the fashion industry. Not only is Advisry an up and coming line making a lot of noise for its unique approach, but the brand has also collaborated on web3 drops in the past. Keith was the designer of the Advisry X CreatureWorld clothing collection, one of the most successful physical web3 drops to date. 

**Collaborators**  

- **Jean-Michel Basquiat Collaboration**

Advisry and [The Estate of Jean-Michel Basqiuat](https://www.basquiat.com/) are collaborating on 10 different pieces that will be debuted on the Advisry runway and be shown later on in the month at the Basqiuat museum. This is among the first collaborations ever that the family of Jean-Michel personally handpicked and approved. The pieces are the first of their kind to utilize never before seen artworks by Jean-Michel.

The fashion show will be closed with three Jean-Michel Basquiat collaboration looks as [Lolo Zouai](https://instagram.com/lolozouai?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) and the orchestra play a cover performance of Tu M’as Trop Ment. 

- **Adidas Collaboration**

Advisry and Adidas are collaborating on a shoe silhouette designed by Keith Herron that will be featured on many looks throughout the runway show. The shoes will be constructed by hand in New York City

- **NOUNS Collaboration**

Featured as one of few collaborations in the fashion show alongside **Adidas** and **Basquiat,** with a trunk designed by Keith Herron alongside highlighting the physical glasses on the models. The Nouns collaboration completes the trio - highlighting fine art, heritage footwear, and the future of intellectual property.

**Budget**

*All production costs of the show will be split with Advisry evenly*

131,Nouns Animated Short Film with Los Angeles Red Carpet Premiere,"# Nouns Animated Short Film with Los Angeles Red Carpet Premiere

My name is Fedja, and I’m a Montenegrin recent USC graduate, writer, and filmmaker. I was introduced to Nouns by Euwyn (Noun #122 and #341), and fell enamored with the sense of community I’ve observed so far. Nounish-ness is special, and I’d love to bottle up a bit of this and spread the word about Nouns to larger audience.

This proposal is for a community-driven, studio-quality animated short film starring a Noun, with a red carpet event in Los Angeles to cap off production and bring Nouns and film community members together to inspire more collaborations.

With an origin story of falling out of their owner’s laptop - think “Finding Nemo” - the protagonist Noun will be animated in stop-motion style, composited on real footage, and film their own journey home. With the Nouns community involvement at each step, the story will be written to be captivating to a broad international audience across different languages, crypto-native and not. 

## Why?

Allow us to introduce you to: The Noun. An animated Noun, fallen out of his owner’s laptop and finding himself lost in the real world. Starting with an animated short, audiences worldwide will watch the charming, adorable, and sneakily snarky Noun overcome obstacles, find and lose love, and much more as he films his journey home. Modernizing the mold of fictional personalities like Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, or Annoying Orange, and inspired by early Pixar shorts, we aim to make the Noun into a well-loved, viral, memeable, sharable character. 

A big part of our effort will be involving the community in writing a unique, compelling narrative for the noun. As a storyteller, this is where I’ll be focused. The intimacy of telling his story from his POV, with his phone camera, intercut with 3rd-person footage of his adventures, will build a lasting emotional relationship with his audience that will transfer into future projects, from this team and others. Whether it be longer YouTube videos, a TV series, or even his own feature film, people will follow the Noun wherever he goes — in the world or online.

His story will be designed to be saturated with clipable, memeable, shareable moments that don’t need context to go viral on their own. However, for the curious viewer, the clips bring them in to a larger narrative designed and produced around a genuine story and loveable protagonist.

## Community-Driven Production

Ultimately, we want the character, and the project as a whole, to be completely emblematic of all that is Nounish. Yes, this means quirkiness, humor, personality and spontaneity, but it also means myriad factors and traits we can’t even begin to predict. This is why throughout the entire creative process we will hold bi-weekly town halls to discuss the script and invite members to share their thoughts. The character bio, the general plot, the finished screenplay, design, locations, all of it. We promise to be receptive to feedback, and additionally will host community feedback sessions to ensure our protagonist is as Nounish as can be.

Along the Noun’s journey, he will inevitably interact with other characters and Nouns in the wild, and while the Noun overcomes loneliness, fear, and anxiety, the story will lead towards an ultimate message of the value of community and collective voice. This will open an opportunity for more creatives to build and expand upon what would effectively become the Nouns Cinematic Universe. Other writers, animators, directors, with their own backgrounds, aesthetic styles, and manners of storytelling, can build upon the framework Noun sets and expand with their own real-world Noun characters and stories.

We’re not only creating a viral character who will bring attention to the Nouns project, but a platform upon which like-minded creatives can find opportunities to build art.

## Development


### Pre-Production

6-8 weeks

- Writing
- Location scouting
- Establishing workflow for animation
- Voice actor casting
- The casting will likely be the longest part of pre-production. In building a project based around the personality of one protagonist, the casting is crucial. We do it once, we do it right.

### Production

6-8 weeks

- Filming
- Recording voice lines
- Animation

### Post-Production

1-2 weeks

- Hiring social media marketing specialist to maximize likelihood of going viral
- Setting up digital marketing strategy (trending hashtags, etc)
- Deploying the videos

![Budget Breakdown](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/e/e272bac8a1a6e48b90b3caa34452bb40323cbf8e.jpeg)


It is our goal to create a professional, polished, award-worthy product. As such, we’re going to need a professional team. Above is our outlined 25 ETH budget, covering a worst-case scenario which can promise a perfect result. We will strive to remain under that budget, however, and any remaining surplus will go towards the following, which we hope piques your interest.

## Los Angeles Red Carpet Premiere 

As the Noun character falls into the real world, so to do we wish to bring this to life. To cap off production, we will host a screening event in Los Angeles with a Nouns step and repeat banner, red carpet, and more, inviting members of the Nouns and film community. It’ll be an opportunity to meet the team behind the project, celebrate together, and provide another occasion for the Nouns community to gather and grow.

## The Team

Who are we!? We’re (mostly) recent graduates out of LA and Austin, Texas, trying to carve our way creatively. With backgrounds in literature, screenwriting, film production, animation, and design, we’re coming together to build something not only with catchy style, but with weighted substance. We don’t just want to work with Nouns to make *something* — we believe we can make something *great.*

# Nouns x Dopamine

*tl:dr: Dopamine & Apenoun propose to collaborate on a Nounish “Non-Fungible Streetwear” drop to be premiered in a Nouns’ exhibition room at Dopamine’s Art Basel Miami launch party.*

*The drop will include ~500 cut-and-sew garments (including t-shirts, hoodies, and more) with cryptographic NFC microchips embedded under Nouns clothing patches, each connected via an on-chain ENS-like chip registry to a Nouns-branded NFT. A white-labeled Nouns browser app will be used for scanning the patch to claim the NFT, as well as for authenticating and verifying the garment owner and manufacturer.* 

*Dopamine, as the first Nouns-fork to incorporate with fashion, would like to include Nouns’ drop as one of a select few to incorporate Dopamine’s new web3 streetwear technology (”Non-Fungible Streetwear”). Nouns streetwear will be sold both at the event and online.*

*Funds requested are 62-82Ξ, with 85% of the primary sales revenue going to the Nouns treasury.*

# Introduction

Dopamine is thrilled to collaborate with Apenoun to design a limited-supply Nouns-branded collection of NFT-bundled streetwear. The collection will feature ~500 Nouns streetwear garments, each of which will be patched with a cryptographic NFC chip connecting on-chain to a Nouns-branded NFT that can be authenticated and claimed through a white-labeled Nouns browser app. The branding and experience for this drop will be Nounish end-to-end, and will fully incorporate Dopamine’s new “Non-Fungible Streetwear” technology.

[Dopamine](http://dopamine.xyz/) is the first Nouns-fork to incorporate fashion, with the mission to empower Web3 projects, NFT artists, and collectors through a community-owned ecosystem for Non-Fungible Streetwear. We are crypto natives with a passion for streetwear culture and web3 technology, aiming to bridge the gap between these two worlds. 

Originally inspired by Nouns’ creative governance and community model, we want to become an incubator for up-and-coming streetwear designers and NFT artists and recreate the “Nouns Virtuous Cycle” for the budding web3 streetwear industry. 

With this collab we’re aiming to push the Nounish culture forward and proliferate the Nouns meme and brand across the Metaverse and into mainstream pop culture using a powerful vehicle for hype: streetwear.

# Designs

Dopamine will work closely with Apenoun to design the garments, which will feature the Noggles and the Nouns slogan “One Noun, Every day, Forever.” Around 500 pieces will be made in total, featuring a combination of t-shirts, hoodies, and various other apparel. Quality-wise, this drop will have a premium feel reminiscent of brands such as Fear of God or Acne Studios, leveraging entirely cut and sew assembly. In terms of past experience, Dopamine’s design team has worked with the likes of Billie Eilish, Young Thug’s Spider, and Siberia Hills. 

In addition to the merchandise design, each garment will feature a Nouns clothing patch covering the NFC chip used to connect to its bound Nouns NFT, which itself will include a digital 3D design of the garment along with additional digital accessories (see next section). Finally, the patch itself will also be capable of triggering an AR hologram of the underlying digital design.

# Non-Fungible Streetwear Technology

Dopamine is creating a decentralized fashion technology platform for authenticating and sharing a new form of chip-microchipped streetwear that we call **“Non-Fungible Streetwear”**.

At the core of each Non-Fungible Streetwear piece is a **physical-bound NFT (PNFT)**, an NFT *forever bound* to the garment through an on-chain registry that uses chip-generated ECDSA signatures for resolution, whose media represents a 3D model of the physical streetwear piece. 

By scanning the garment’s patched chip with Dopamine’s white-labeled browser app, garment owners will be able to claim the PNFT, authenticate collection and manufacturer details, and view digital renditions of their streetwear in a 3D-like wardrobe. On top of this, PNFTs may be composed with arbitrary numbers of other digital assets, such as NFTs representing brand-related digital art, music, or perks. 

Below, we dive into more detail on the customization process, on-chain connectivity layer, and scanning flow as it relates to Nouns’ curated Non-Fungible Streetwear collection. 

### Customization Process

![wip10](https://i.imgur.com/gErPzVi.jpg)

The following assets will be required for the Nouns’ Non-Fungible Streetwear collection:

- **Nouns 3D PNFT Design**
The design file for the PNFT, which in this case will be a 3D digital rendition of the Nouns physical garment bundled as a GLTF file.
- **Nouns Accessory Media Files**
Additional digital media files may be provided to build accessory NFTs. These could be anything from Nouns Art Basel POAPs to complementary Nouns digital avatars. Unlike the PNFTs which are forever bound to their garments, these accessory NFTs may be attached and detached on-chain to allow for composability with any Non-Fungible Streetwear pieces.
- **Nouns PNFT Collection Specs**
Ownership attribution for the Nouns’ Non-Fungible Streetwear will revolve around a custom ERC721-compatible Nouns PNFT collection with a fixed supply of ~500, reflecting the total number of garments distributed. Besides the aforementioned accessorizing, additional specs may be added here, such as collection-wide metadata or whitelisting support.

### On-Chain Connectivity

![11](https://i.imgur.com/zs3fcSV.png)

Connection between Nouns streetwear garments to Nouns PNFTs will be entirely on-chain, and will involve three major components: 

**NFC Chip**

Dopamine NFC microchips are machine-washable ~30mm round, 1mm thick chips capable of signing messages. Scanning the patched chip will enable chip-signed attestations (secured at the firmware level) to be passed through the on-chain registry to the Nouns browser app for authentication and claiming.

**Chip Registry**

An ENS-like on-chain registry mapping chip ids to PNFTs will be used for connecting physical and digital worlds together in a truly decentralized manner. Included in each record will be a pre-registered IPFS cert provided by Nouns (e.g. an attestation signed by Nouns Deployer) and the chip manufacturer. 

**Nouns PNFTs**

Nouns PNFTs will act as the virtual representation and authentication interface for the Nouns’ streetwear garments. Unlike most NFTs, which are normally only owned by a user EOA, these will include two forms of ownership attribution - one involving the garment owner, and one involving the paired chip itself. 

### Browser App

The three above components allow the white-labeled Nouns browser app to process claims, verifications, and transfers in a way that is truly 100% decentralized. Below, we outline at a high-level how claims and normal scans work:

**Claims:**

![12](https://i.imgur.com/KLykF7M.png)

Dopamine's Non-Fungible Streetwear uses a physical-first standard for claiming. This means that recipients of the Nouns’ Non-Fungible Streetwear collection will first get the physical garment, and then scan the patched chip using the Nouns browser app shown above to have the ownership attribution of the PNFT assigned to them. For security reasons, only addresses of those which have purchased the collection pieces (either online or live at Art Basel) will be able to invoke the initial claim.

**Scans:**

![13](https://i.imgur.com/uWHAKW2.png)

Anyone with an NFC-enabled smart device will be able to tap their devices on the Nouns’ chip patches to view details regarding garment owner and authenticity through the Nouns browser app. In addition, these scans will showcase the PNFT media assets in an interactive 3D wardrobe-like environment, along with any bundled accessories.

## Dopamineland @ **Art Basel Miami**

The Nouns x Dopamine drop will feature at our Art Basel Miami multi-day event “Dopamineland” as part of a select group of 5 partners representing the best and the brightest of web3 culture and meme power. 

The Nouns area will be a fully Nouns-branded immersive experience featuring on-site “activations” giving users direct interaction with the Nouns bundles and their physical-digital features.

Nouns Non-Fungible Streetwear will be available for purchase on-site and online via credit card or ETH. For online orders, shipments will be handled through Shopify.

## Nouns x Dopamine Bundle Cost Breakdown

Supply: ~500 (TBD)

Costs: ~82Ξ

134,Liberating Proposal Threshold for 26 years,"# Liberating Proposal Threshold for 26 years

Change the threshold to put a proposal on-chain from the current 2 votes to 1 vote.

Why:
- We are disenfranchising roughly 80% of noun holders currently.
- We are not seeing many proposals coming in.
- We want to empower any nouner or delegate to participate in the DAO.

Setting the proposal threshold to 1 would require 2 votes again once we passed 9999 nouns in roughly 26 years.

135,Xanadu x Nouns: Mega Episode + Real-time Nouns World Toolkit,"# Xanadu x Nouns: Mega Episode + Real-time Nouns World Toolkit

Dear NounsDAO,

Welcome to Xanadu… a story world made by one dude with godlike creation powers forging a new category of entertainment that twists fiction with reality and collides pop culture with the coolest things on the internet. It’s a wild, novel genre that’s inspiring a new generation of creators, artists, and storytellers. 

### Click image to watch Blu present the proposal
[![Image alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ktZaS52qyYA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktZaS52qyYA) 

We’re a team of two with a shared passion for bringing avatars and worlds to life. We want to help bring Nouns into the 3D metaverse with our unique storytelling and world-building skills. We propose a XANADU x NOUNS collaboration consisting of two parts:

### Part One - Nouns Episode of Xanadu 
We would create a mega-episode of Xanadu where Blu, the hero of Xanadu, teams up with Nouns in an action-packed deep dive into the Nouns Universe.

The episode features Blu questing through Planet Nouns desperate for the Nouns help to save him from a posse of intergalactic gangsters. To satisfy the bounty on his head, Blu must submit a winning proposal to Nouns DAO which kicks off a wild escapade through the Nouns City Center, the historic Nouner Capitol building, and the Nouns Underground. Along the way, Blu meets a master Noun who gives him a crash course on NounsDAO, how it works and why it’s awesome — education disguised as Hollywood quality entertainment. But it doesn’t stop there…

![Alt Text](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/e/e4951cf151fd7bfb2f983a7dbcb7ed901ce5614d.gif)

### Part Two - CC0 Nouns Toolkit
Unlike a Hollywood feature where all the creativity and work vanish after the movie’s made, all of the Nouns assets created for this episode will be crafted into a Nouns World Toolkit that will live on in an innovative and powerful new way — in the hands of the community, available CC0.
This is more than a simple library of assets…

Because Xanadu is built in a game engine (Unreal Engine 5), it’s a story world that can be cinematic, interactive, gamified, live-streamed, or experienced in VR. So, armed with this massive toolkit of AAA animatable Nouns characters & pre-lit, animated environments — complete with how-to guide books & tutorials created by us — the Nouns community can inhabit a Noun for VTubing, Zoom calls, or create cinematic content, marketing materials, NFTs, or even build a Nouns VR experience, game, or metaverse. It’s our hope for this to become the beginning of a dynamic Nouns repository that grows over time and is contributed to by other builders. (Full list of Toolkit deliverables below in Extra Details)

![Alt Text](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/1/137fa14e33c6b60152c5c4700e5f77bb82b719f1.gif)

### How does this benefit NounsDAO?
- **The Episode** — Exposure for NounsDAO in a novel, powerful narrative – with analytics & insights (average results per episode: 2.7M impressions, 321K views, 12K watch-time hours)
- **The Toolkit** — 3D tools that enables Nouns creators, creations, remixes with other IPs, and continued proliferation of Nouns to a new degree.
- **Our Vision** — Inspire creators with the episode, enable creations with the toolkit, and catalyze a cohort of Nouns as VTubers and next-generation virtual avatars.

### Community 
Working directly with the Nouns community is key for this project in several ways:
1. **Help choose what Nouns derivatives to feature** such as LilNouns, SharkDAO, skateboards from GnarsDAO, and art pieces from prop house. We love the extended Nouns community want to infuse this thriving ecosystem into the Toolkit and Episode.
2. **Help define the 3D style of the Nouns characters and environments**, as well as how Nouns express themselves using motion capture and animation.
3. **Help choose Nouns characters to be featured in the episode.** Some Nouns will be chosen for story purposes but we’d love the community to vote on what other Nouns get featured. Those Nouns holders will have the option to voice & motion capture their own Noun (assuming there’s dialogue).

### The General Timeline
* Phase 1: **Concept & Design + Episode Writing.** starts immediately (est 2 months)
* Phase 2: **Asset creation.** Starts as concepts complete (est 2-3 months) Will overlap with Phase 1
* Phase 3: **Launch Beta Repository.** Nov 2022 Assets are made available as they are created.
* Phase 4: **Episode Production Starts** Jan 2023 *When assets are finished (est 3 months)
Est Episode completion March 2023

### Toolkit Repository Timeline
* Phase 1: **Launch Beta Repository.** Nov 2022 Post assets as they become available
* Phase 2: **Create Beta How to Docs & Tutorials.** (these will roll out starting in Dec thru March)
* Phase 3: **Launch final Toolkit Repository.** March 2023
We will be sharing fun BTS & asset creation along the way via YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram content.

### Our Ask & Budget Breakdown 
We are asking for a total of $307.2K USD (192E @ $1600)
* Toolkit Concept Art & Design — $20,480 (12.8ETH)
* Toolkit 3D Modeling & Texturing — $99,040 (61.9ETH)
* Nouns Character Modeling & Rigging — $33,440 (20.9ETH)
* Toolkit Assembly & Episode Production — $141,280 (88.3ETH)
* Toolkit publishing & maintenance — $12,960 (8.1ETH)

The proposed budget + 15% to cover volatility will be converted to USDC immediately, and everything in excess will be retrurned to the DAO. If, due to high volatility, there is insufficient ETH to cover the proposed budget (307.2K USD), a second proposal will be made.
* Total: 192ETH * 1.15 = 220.8ETH

## Extra Details

### The Nouns World Toolkit Repository 
The CCO repository will consist of the cast of Nouns characters and environments made for the episode. Everything will be set up in the Unreal Engine (Free game engine software) and we're going to include all the scenes, cameras, lighting and animation from the episode which means, the Nouns City center will be alive with ambient animation and amazing cinematic lighting.  Additionally, the scenes from the episode will provide a starting point for making new content that looks amazing. All the Nouns characters will be rigged and ready for motion capture style animation (Both face and body similar to how Blu is setup in Xanadu).  For those with the right gear, this means you can instantly puppet any of those Nouns for V-Tubbing or creating your own cinematic content.  We're also exploring 'off the shelf' webcam mocap solutions (Cheap or free but body motion quality not as good as the expensive mocap suites) to include, if possible, to make inhabiting the nouns characters more accessible.  This would also allow using Nouns for Zoom calls, etc. 

### Nouns World Toolkit Details
* 12 Hero Nouns (Face & Body fully rigged for motion capture)
* 24 Secondary Nouns (Body fully rigged for motion capture. Minimal to no facial animation)
* Beautifully lit and fully animated environments:
* Nouns Downtown City Center (exterior, like Time Square)
        * Buildings reflecting the Nouns extended family
* Nouner Capitol Building (Exterior & Interior) 
* Nouns underground city / town (Exterior)
* Noun masters Dojo (Exterior & Interior)
* General modular city assets *for building new structures
* General nounish props & furniture 
* Nouns transport vehicles
* Wide Establishing model of the Nouns Planet
* Guide Book & Tutorials on using the Toolkit to create Vtuber & Cinematic content 

### Technical Details
* Unreal Engine 5 project - CC0
* Assets performant in Real-time (Streaming)
* Assets performant in VR
* Fully animated Hero scenes from episode included as examples
        * All hero Nouns characters ready for motion capture (Face and Body)

### Production Team
* Art Direction, Episode Writing & Directing
* Producer
* Lighting
* Motion Capture
* Animation
* Cinematography
* UE4 Integration & Tooling
* VFX
* Actors
* Editing
* Music
* Sound Design

### Episode Details
* 20-30 minutes

### About Xanadu & beyond
The heart of Xanadu is its zany stories and wild characters, but its soul burns to bridge and play in other universes. Thus Blu wants to help bring to life the budding spectrum of web3 Pop-Cultures from Nouns, cloneX and BAYC to small burgeoning Avatar projects backed by talented teams or individuals. All so they can collide on a bigger, more wild stage, with bigger, more wild crossover stories! Think Ready Player One and the Marvel Universe but creator content style!

### FUN BONUS IDEA: Wild Story Twist!
Blu’s adventure with the Nouns will live on beyond this episode in a ‘first-of-its-kind’ melding of entertainment & reality; After this episode airs, Blu’s fictional proposal (The one he formulates in the episode with help from the Nouns) is actually a real proposal that he submits to the Nouns DAO… and the outcome of that proposal dictates Blu’s future storyline – Will his proposal be good enough for approval, or will Blu have to evade the gangsters and find another solution to survive?

If you haven’t seen Xanadu yet, check it out [Xanadu on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/xanaduBlu) and our original proposal teaser.

136,Founding Partners of NFT Seattle,"# Founding Partners of NFT Seattle

(*TLDR, NFT Seattle is the first large scale Web3 event in the entire Pacific Northwest. We think it would be pretty sweet if the Nouns came in as title sponsors of this inaugural event*)

### **DESCRIPTION**

- Becoming the Nounding Partners / Presenting Sponsors of NFT Seattle creates an opportunity for the Nouns to build relationships with the Pacific Northwest’s Web3 community and solidify the Noun meme in the foundation of these new relationships.
- As we establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation, we'd love for the Nouns to come in at the ground level and cement the meme as an integral part of Seattle’s Web3 ecosystem, positioned for maximum and lasting brand exposure. The Web3 community is still growing in Seattle so the probability of reaching new people (vs people that already know about the Nouns) is likely higher here, than most other major US cities. Plus Seattle's technically inclined demographic lends itself well to everything the Nouns stand for, though people here are still warming up to the whole idea of NFT's.

### **WHAT IS NFT SEATTLE**

- NFT Seattle is the first event catering to the broader Web3 community in the Pacific Northwest (Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, BC).
- The vision behind NFT Seattle is to establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation & connect the growing community in the Northwest. We want to unite people in Seattle to educate & expose them to the opportunities & possibilities that Web3 brings to creators, businesses, artists, and communities.
- This event is mainly targeting the Web3 curious and as such, has a heavier leaning towards education.
- NFT Seattle will take place from 9/30/2022 - 10/1/2022 in Seattle at several venues including Block 41 and the Seattle NFT Museum (the worlds first NFT Museum).

### **WHY SHOULD NOUNS BE INVOLVED & WHY IT MATTERS?**

- NFT Seattle presents a unique opportunity for the Nouns to proliferate the Nouns meme and imagery (think, Noggles in downtown Seattle) across a region that is still trying to figure out Web3 but is on the cusp of a major Web3 breakout. A region that has already cemented itself as a global hub for technological and cultural innovation, with everything from Amazon/Microsoft to Starbucks and many more having been birthed here.
- As the first Web3 event in the Pacific Northwest, NFT Seattle will draw people in from Portland, Seattle, Vancouver BC and will lean heavily towards education plus fostering deep, meaningful connection between brands, thought leaders and other attendees. Early data suggests the audience will be a healthy mix between the Web3 curious, and those that are pioneering in the space.
- This event also creates a perfect opportunity for an IRL Noun meetup, for Nouns that are local to the region to come and engage with the local community while providing *Nouns on the Ground* an opportunity to execute their existing IRL events strategy, in a new untapped market. Also, hoping to partner with the Nounish marketing team to up-level the Nounishness of this activation if the prop passes. (Initial conversations have been started).

### **THE BREAKDOWN**

- **Presenting Title Sponsor of NFT Seattle** (”NFT Seattle presented by the Nouns”). Nouns branding will be prominently featured at the Event and the official After Party.
    
 
![](https://i.imgur.com/jDWDkc8.png)


    
- **Live Art Premier** that is nouns-inspired and incorporates the noggles, showcased by local high profile NFT artist [Jaiden ‘Jasti’ Stipp](https://www.instagram.com/jastidesigns/), the 16yr old that made over a million selling NFT's.
- As a way of thanking the Nouns for being a founding event partner for NFT Seattle, this commemorative art-piece will become a permanent fixture at every NFT Seattle annual event, an exclusive benefit only being extended to the Nouns. We’ll store this piece for future use, or the Nouns can opt to claim it for use at other IRL events.
- **Evergreen Video Content** to drive meme awareness and exposure: 2 daily sizzle Reels to be shared upon completion of each event day specifically highlighting the Nouns, and 1 sizzle Reel showcasing the creation of the custom mural. Video content to be produced by local media partner Brandtegic.
- **Nouns Branding exclusively featured on each String Backpack** provided to all attendees upon entry. Nouns stickers and swag will also be included in each swag bag (we'd need help designing the stickers).
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/poa1pxT.jpg)


    
- **Nouns Branding prominently featured on Social, Website, and Emails** that will be widely visible to all attendees, the public, and reviewed by various news outlets and media partners. We just recently kicked off a regional PR campaign, the Nouns imagery will be added to the the forefront of all marketing materials associated with the event as a title sponsor.

- **Fireside chat with a Noun**, an optional speaking opportunity where a designated Noun can share a bit about how the Nouns continue to play a key role in the advancement of the overall DAO ecosystem via the prop house model or a deep dive into cc0 NFT's, using Nouns as a use-case.


### **THE ASK**

This is a title sponsorship for NFT Seattle, and cost breakdown will be as follows:

- $65,000 USD ~ 40 ETH (calculated at 1 ETH = $1,600)
    - 10 ETH - Towards venue costs + event production team (labor)
    - 16 ETH - Towards A/V production + other venue related expenses
    - 10 ETH - Towards PR campaign, advertising, event marketing, videographers and video editing. (This includes printing graphics for all Nouns signage and marketing materials)
    - 4 ETH - Live painted Nouns inspired mural/art piece by Jasti (reusable at future events)
    
    ***N.B.** This cost also factors in event admission for Nouns that wish to attend (up until a pre-negotiated number) as well as an optional booth activation, if there are nouns on the ground available to man it.*
    

### **WHY SEATTLE**

- Seattle is an emerging market in Web3 with events just starting to take place. (ETHSeattle, blockchain events, and now NFT Seattle)
- Starbucks is entering Web3 and launching an NFT collection ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/04/starbucks-teases-web-3-platform-in-nft-announcement/)) and it’s in good company among other major brands with a substantial presence in Washington who are either ALL-IN or dabbling in Web3- Salesforce, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple.
- Besides SF, Seattle has more tech talent than any other city in the country ([425 Business](https://www.425business.com/news/greater-seattle-no-2-in-tech-talent-report/article_37815015-8e5d-58f2-81fa-593715c7f695.html)) and it’s also the country’s most desired location for people aged 18 to 24 ([Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/cost-of-living/seattle-wa/)), making the city an ideal place for Web3 brands to establish a presence in order to attract and retain top talent.
- 75% or more of PNW Angel Investors are interested in Web3 companies and founders. ([Madrona Venture Group](https://www.madrona.com/angel-investors-pacific-northwest-directory/))
- Seattle is the US’ primary gateway to Asia, the best city in America for outdoor activities, the 13th best city to live in overall, and the eighth-best city for raising a family. ([Patch.com](https://patch.com/washington/seattle/seattle-ranks-high-2022-best-places-live-list))
- There is a growing list of startups in Seattle building crypto, blockchain, and Web3 technologies such as Irreverent Labs, CoinMe, Nori, ArcBlock, Bittrex, CypherD, DragonChain, Luxor (Source: [GeekWire](https://www.geekwire.com/2022/a-list-of-startups-in-seattle-building-crypto-blockchain-and-web3-technologies/))

137,Mucho Love 4 Month Extension,"# Mucho Love 4 Month Extension

![](https://i.imgur.com/VhBvzNf.jpg)
#### tl;dr:

A volunteering community focused on proliferating Nouns combining volunteering campaigns, community service, and social action.

### Where did Mucho Love come from?

A little bit over a month ago, the prop.house 655 & 656 ([Prop House ](https://prop.house/proposal/656) and [Prop House ](https://prop.house/proposal/655)) passed to fund “Nounifying Children’s Hearts.” This proposal supported the pilot for starting a volunteering community with the target of evolving into a Decentralized Non-Profit Organization.

### What is Mucho Love?

Mucho Love (a lot of love) is a community that seeks to contribute to various causes one event at a time while proliferating Nouns. **Mucho Love is born from the desire to help, creating a community that focuses on volunteer campaigns, community service, and social action**. We seek to impact various causes by addressing problems that affect our society. Mucho Love aims to cultivate a community in which all members feel part of something bigger than themselves, making them feel nounish.

### How does Mucho Love work?

Mucho Love was created by 5 founders, who wear many hats and structured what it is today. We plan to expand the team next year to escalate further and establish more specific scopes. Currently, we have over 30 community members eager to volunteer for the causes we are aiding.

Mucho Love currently works on a 9-step system.

1. **Ideation:** planning and deciding on activities.
2. **Outreach:** contacting the organizations/places, writing letters/petitions, and setting up dates/places.
3. **Chronogram/Requirements:** Itinerary, step-by-step program to be performed on events, pre-event checklist, proofreading.
4. **Quotations:** quotation of each item or service (3 quotations from different companies per item or service)
5. **Payments and Negotiations:** negotiating with businesses, establishing formal relationships, explaining MUCHO LOVE, and paying for services/items.
6. **Pre-Event:** revision of the pre-event checklist, volunteer count, and Zoom meetings with volunteers and multimedia team to prepare for the event.
7. **Event Day:** role call, transportation to the event, itinerary execution, feedback.
8. **Post Event:** post-event multimedia management and feedback from participants.
9. **Documentation:** establishing the framework to replicate the current working system by documenting for the continuous improvement of the project.

### How does this benefit the DAO?

**Charity** is a recurrent activity/topic within the Nounish ecosystem—that’s why we decided to start a nounish volunteering community that makes sure to proliferate Nouns with the values and vision it represents. **Mucho Love aims to become one of the Nounish platforms regarding community service, social work, and volunteering campaigns.** Mucho Love’s activities will all be shared through Twitter and Instagram, appealing to the masses and expanding global Noggle adoption.

Mucho Love is starting operations in the Dominican Republic but aims to develop a model that is replicable internationally. Also, if needed, we want to be able to travel to any part of the world to aid any team who needs help developing charitable efforts in their respective communities. 

### Goals

Our goal is to **establish the foundation of Mucho Love as a future Decentralized Non-Profit Organization** **that will allow us to replicate the model in any part of the world.** The structure/model created will be available for any team that wants to make charitable efforts in their respective communities. We also want to keep collaborating with established Nounish projects (like BigShotKlim’s pins and Messhup’s books) that can contribute with donations to proliferate Nouns further.

Mucho Love will carry out during the 4-month extension events/donations/activities among the following:

* Hospital Robert Ried
* Hospital Hugo Mendoza
* Red Misericordia (Orphanage)
* Hogar Escuela Santo Domingo Savio (Orphanage/School)
* Escuelita Café con Leche (Orphanage/School)

*2 institutions have not given a definitive yes; therefore, they are subject to change.

### Pilot results

The pilot successfully helped children feel joy despite going through difficult moments. We also showed what the Noggles are and what they can do. People fell in love with Messhup’s books and BigShotKlim’s Noggle pins. Children that used glasses felt even more identified with the Noggles. I can genuinely say that the pilot was a success; the Noggles were well received, and we helped out 300 children and their parents while proliferating Nouns, love, and optimism.

300 Children received 300 Nounish goodie bags containing:

* Messhup’s coloring book (300 total)
* Crayola box (300 total)
* Diapers (1440 total)
* Stickers (600 total)
* BigShotKlim’s Noggle Pins (100 total)

138,Nouns X Internet Game: Season 2 w/ gmoney,"# Nouns X Internet Game: Season 2 w/ gmoney

**Dear NounsDAO,**

I’m a *huge* fans of Nouns. A big part of my Solidity education was forking the Nouns contract back when we were at Noun #3. So I’m super thrilled to present an idea that integrates Nouns into what I've been working on for 2 years, & can contribute to the Nounish goal of spreading the Nouns meme far & wide.

----

**TLDR:** We are Internet Game. We host massive web3 game shows with thousands of players and blue-chip NFT prizes. Our Season 2 is coming up next, hosted by gmoney, and we’d like to re-skin one of the games to feature Nouns, as well as educate our players about Nouns with a video prior to the game.

Before we get into specifics, we’ll share a bit more about who we are and why we’re qualified to propose this…

## What is Internet Game??

[Internet Game](https://internet.game/) is Squid Game meets NFTs. We create live, interactive game shows that anyone can play at home with hyper-simple, yet dangerously fun mini-games. 60% of buy-ins go to blue-chip NFT prizes, all voted on by the community in Discord.

In March 2022 we launched our Internet Game: [Season 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ut4uEdKyydQ3lFZFoGIMUWpsqXQh_ZE3NugP6UGIE-c/edit#slide=id.g13ad4d9e874_0_0). 8000 players minted $2.2M in NFTs to play. We then purchased $1M+ in NFT prizes as voted on by the players, including Bored Apes, Mutant Apes, Doodles, Azukis, CloneX and many more.

The best way to fully understand how our seasons work is to[ look at this case study](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ut4uEdKyydQ3lFZFoGIMUWpsqXQh_ZE3NugP6UGIE-c/edit#slide=id.p).

Internet Game: Season 2 “Bear Market Battle” launches on September 12th. Season 2 features 6 brand new games taking place between September 12th and 23rd. The entire event is hosted by the infamous gmoney & comedian Leah Lamarr. Gmoney will appear as a full 3D version of his cryptopunk by being rigged up in a high-fidelity motion capture suit, and will then be superimposed on an XR stage (picture a gigantic LED screen & floor) next to Leah.

## Season 2 Trailer:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lr3GruECkk

Here’s a preview of what that looks like from the podcast we did with gmoney on the XR stage with him in the co-cap suit:

![|624x323](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/R2_yJv7VgaZlSyENj-pB3qwG82IdRuM9S1i94XuvPAeTjmR2gD5Hnqiz-vE7NWVMMAFtEY4ZTSFat4h1jg9DTlxnubOXHtnfWIhRnJIAmcmypoVrmrmuGvGc5RIU2Hw-z3xxbllb31NhvAAY-eXIk8w)

## The Opportunity: Nouns Game + Video in Season 2

Internet Game Season 2 is made up of 6 mini-games that take place over the course of two weeks. Each game runs for 24 hours.

There is an opportunity to fully brand the third game, currently titled as “The Last Spaceship”, and transform it into “The Last Noun”.

The game itself is similar to an old school Asteroids / Galaga space shooter, but with an original take on how you move around the space. We think the 2D arcade aesthetic is a perfect match for the Nouns art. Both the main character as well as the enemies would be Nouns:

After the completion of Season 2, “The Last Noun” will exist on the Internet Game Arcade (launching Q1 2023) and used in future tournaments with other Discords, influencers and NFT communities, bringing consistent exposure to the brand to a variety of audiences.

## The Video

A video is shown before each of the games featuring gmoney & Leah. If desired, we could include a trailer / explainer / hype video for Nouns in that video. This would need to be provided by Nouns DAO.

**Additional opportunities during Season 2:**

* Including Nouns and/or Lil Nouns in our prize pool
* Skinning the entire Internet Game tournament page during “The Last Noun” game to be Nouns-branded
* Upon the launch of the game, post a write up on our social platforms (Twitter/Discord) to educate our audience on Nouns DAO and the Nouns mission & mechanics

## Our Ask:

**ETH Sponsorship:** Nouns DAO would contribute 20 ETH to Internet Game Season 2. The sponsorship would be split to further contribute to the prize pool and cover operational expenditures incurred by Internet Game.

## Proposed Timeline & Next Steps

* Engage in discussions to answer any questions derived from this proposal
* Gain approval to transform “The Last Spaceship” into “The Last Noun”
* Announce partnership with Nouns DAO for Season 2 including the donation to the prize pool
* Complete redesign of the tournament page and game and showcase to Nouns DAO for feedback
* Launch “The Last Noun” Game on September 16th, along with the optional pre-game video

## Long-Term Opportunity: Nouns Custom Casual Game

We we would love to continue the relationship and build a fully custom game for Nouns that can live on in perpetuity. The game would be co-created by the DAO and Internet Game to provide a unique experience that allows consumers to connect with the Nouns brand in an interactive way. Casual gaming is a juggernaut of an industry due to its accessibility (ease of learning), low effort requirement, and repeat value (easy to hop in and out of) it provides. We see a Nouns Game as a way to engage the general population in a highly scalable and interactive way all around the world. Details on this longer-term partnership opportunity can be submitted through a separate proposal.

## **TL;DR** 

Noun Sounds will provide a much needed audio-scape to the Nouns ecosystem.  SuperTightWoody and Papaya will create a platform and ingest processes where anyone can create, export and contribute CC0 Nounish songs, stems, samples, sounds effects and more.

![](https://i.imgur.com/96a5gtJ.png)

# The Problem

There is currently no Nouns audio aesthetic, and no environment for it to flourish. There are no sonic logos, sounds or songs that have a consistent use case in the Nouns world. Nounish creators of apps, videos, games and beyond have nowhere to turn for audio. 

Nounish creators have to source their own audio, often out of their own pocket while being forced to manage limited use rights.

All of this makes brand consistency/recognition difficult and next to impossible. Sonic logos, sounds or songs are a core part of any brand.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/VN0FNJY.png)


# Our Solution

**nounsounds.wtf**

We will create a robust website that will act as a hub for all things related to Nouns audio. This will include an easy to use music “PLAYground” to build a unique Nouns song for your project, a repository of samples/sounds/songs and a robust roadmap with processes and structure, allowing our environment to grow.

![](https://i.imgur.com/UevPiIZ.png)

---

# The User Experience

## **Homepage**

![](https://i.imgur.com/Z53wdaT.png)

On the homepage, the latest Noun Sound will be displayed along with the Noun it generates!  **This, and all Noun Sounds, will be available for free use and CC0**.

 How does it generate this Noun Sound you might ask?  Let’s head over to the…

## **PLAYground**

![](https://i.imgur.com/pwDMdY5.png)

The visual Noun will be generated via the PLAYground tab.  

In this area, a song is split into its different tracks. Here, one of the 10 songs created for Nouns will be selected.  Each song will contain 5 variations per instrument. Each instrument will correspond to a Nouns layer whose assets will be randomly generated when the page loads. 

Refreshing the page or hitting the “Randomize” button will randomly select a new SONG and new set of LAYERS.  Every time you create a new Nouns Sound, a unique new Noun will be born to accompany it!

Put together your favorite song tracks for your project and…VOILA!  You now have your own unique Noun Sound.

## **Sounds**

![](https://i.imgur.com/9DU37V1.png)

If you want to grab any of the full songs, stems, loops, samples or sound effects by themselves- this is the place to go.  Easily filter these via metadata and get to creating your Nounish multimedia! 

# How Does This Proliferate Nouns?

***Sound*** is the backbone of any cohesive brand and multimedia creation.  This CC0 resource will assist in the production of music, apps, games, videos, social content, sonic branding and more- all revolving around Nouns.  As we work along side Nouns DAO in the future, a self sustaining library of high quality audio will fill a void for creators across all mediums of creative content. 

# The Team

With 20+ years of music production and engineering experience, **SuperTightWoody** is a Grammy Nominated music producer.  Having works featured on major label albums, TV shows, movie trailers and television commercials.  In the Nouns space, he has created the theme song for the Nouncil along with theme songs for The Noun Square Twitter spaces (and the “soundboard” for TNS).  As a Nouncil and TNS member- he is very much looking forward to expanding his contributions into the Nouns space.

**Papaya** is a software engineer with 15+ years of experience known for his attention to detail. He has worked on numerous NFT Collections, tools and Defi protocols. He loves building unique experiences for web3 communities and developers. 

# Timeline

The creation of everything laid out in this first proposal will take 3 months to complete from proposal approval.

# Proposed Funding

72ETH for deliverables + timeline.

**III. FUTURE STEPS**
___

Our 10,000 physical toys will be utilized for both sales and giveaways for maximum reach and value. We believe that both are important aspect of this proof of concept model moving forward:

 - 10% -1,000 toys(100 sets) allocated to community members and other Nouns initiatives like Nouns OTG, Rose Bowl and Art Basel Miami etc. Final production Toys will be allocated and shipped from our warehouse (worldwide approx shipping/handling cost $35 per case of toys) 
 - 9,000 units to be sold at SRP $14/toy, or approx $7 wholesale + shipping. Portion of the sales will be used to develop series 2 and put forth in a proposal if the project is a success. 
 - Option for DAO allocated additional quantities from this edition at $7/unit 
 - Option to re-order at lower unit cost ($5-6/unit) in a future run.
 - Option to create unique colorways & revised single-unit packaging at lower unit cost.
 - A collectible card with a POAP is included with each toy. Use TBD, but it will help with future engagement and retain customer attention.Collectors and fans could receive digital goodies, participate in games, contests or win prizes from our NOUNWORKS shop, and/or have access to unique experiences for POAP holders only. Goodies and prizes can be things in our shops or future items from the community based on the promotions and future partnerships and collaborations(TBD) based on Nounish partners and collaborations.

It is imperative that we expedite manufacturing so that we can have product ready for public introduction and review at Designercon in November 18-20 2022 (10X20 Booth booked), Art Basel in Miami in December, and possible availability for distribution at Rose Bowl (Jan 1, 2023) with Stoopid Buddy Studios. We can support global meet ups with products as well as some blank figures for local artists to paint.



All of the items ship from a central location in USA so the marketing and proliferation logistics are perfectly aligned. These steps, including ongoing press and social media support, are crucial to any project of this scope and everything has a price. Since we have multiple ongoing projects with NOUNs and plan many more, we want to be as efficient as possible with our time as well as resources.
We are excited to create and distribute the very best  Nouns toys! We have built out a model that is scalable for large-scale runs in the future after this concept is proven.

*This proposal submission was executed by [Gnars DAO](https://gnars.com).*

Nounify the skate lane in the Gigoia Island community and onboard 120 teenagers – from 11 to 14 years old – to web3 at the *[Skate Cuida Institute](https://www.instagram.com/skatecuida/?hl=pt)* - both in Rio de Janeiro.

**Why?**

According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/), **Brazil is the 2nd country with the most people using NFTs (5M users).**

![](https://i.imgur.com/d7fhQsI.png)

Rio de Janeiro stands out as a crypto hub. In June, the 1st international NFT event in Brazil took place in the city. Gathering renowned Brazilian artists, collections of different styles and lectures about web3, NFTs and DAOs, NFT Rio showed the potential of the Brazilian market.

The Nouns DAO featured as one of the main collections during the event. [After the approval of proposal 98](https://nouns.wtf/vote/98), [@beautyandpunk](https://twitter.com/beautyandpunk), [@leoclark](https://twitter.com/leoclark) and [@fabioseva](https://twitter.com/fabioseva) did a great job spreading the noun culture at the conference. We want to further develop this work.

For this, the plan is to:
## 1) Promote 4 educational workshops about web3 in Gigoia Island, Rio de Janeiro/RJ.

**a) Wallets and tokens:** first, a “magic trick” makes money disappear… and reappear inside the pocket of an attendee. The instructor explains what are “the secret crypto words”, how they can “control magic internet money”, and how anyone - even kids - can earn, use or store such money.

**b) NFTs:** the instructor shows attendees how digital wallets can hold other digital stuff. A series of these valuable things have been scattered through the Skate Cuida Institute (QR codes linking to a minting page). A treasure hunt leads attendees to earn their first NFTs.

**c) DAO:** the instructor shows a site where they can use their NFTs as tickets to join a club. He tells them there is a proposal there where they can vote for a prize that will be distributed either to half the “club”… or to all of its members - depending on how they vote it. The instructor reveals the results (awarding a prize in crypto to every participant) and teaches basic concepts in cooperation and game theory. He tells the audience the workshop was sponsored by a “club”, too - NounsDAO - that collaborates online to do cool stuff in the real world. And incites attendees they can do the same via the club they now belong to.

**d) Skate & Lunch:** to wrap things up, Bob Burnquist invites the kids for a ride on the Institute’s track, then **food and drinks** are served for all.

We plan to bring 30 kids in each workshop. The goal is to **introduce 120 people to crypto and NFTs** via Nouns DAO.

The end goal is to find a format ([presentation here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFHzoOmwAE/OhifeRzHPUSLD7X1YLORVQ/view?utm_content=DAFHzoOmwAE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishpresent)) that can be replicated in other communities in a cost-effective way.

**The workshops will be conducted by guiriba, a member of Paradigma Education**. Paradigma is a crypto research house in Brazil with experience ranging from [materials for beginners](https://paradigma.docsend.com/view/vzysv4pg3evfqry9) to courses to [analysis for experts.](https://app.paradigma.education/feed/post/view?id=kru2M8m98ePrweKAjXeu)

## 2) Nounify the skateboard track of Gigoia Island, Rio de Janeiro/RJ.

Right: the Brazilian version of Skater Noun was created by [Ozzz](https://twitter.com/ozzzmabro), member of the [Mafriends](https://twitter.com/MafriendsArt) collective.*

While the workshop takes place, Nouns artwork by Brazilian artists will be painted at the Skate Cuida Institute, where classes are taught by Bob Burnquist.
We will bring a film crew and later deliver a clip registering the workshops and painting action.

## 3) Make a donation to the Skate Cuida Institute.

Purchase 3 VR headsets and 3 notebooks for the institute, to support the 4 weekly encounters currently held there, where kids receive cognitive training, skateboarding lessons, food and a safe space to play.

### What is the Skate Cuida Institute and who is Bob Burnquist?

Bob Burnquist is the greatest X-Games winner in history.

A Brazilian skateboarder & ex-videogame star, he now aims to empower unprivileged communities through sports, education and technology.

Skate Cuida Institute is a place in Rio with modest infrastructure where Bob and his team receive dozens of youngsters a week to study and skate together.

Bob is also avowedly a crypto-native. In 2021, he launched his first NFT collection, [Burnquist Gold.](https://twitter.com/bobburnquist/status/1446965292836524039) A fan of the Tezos blockchain, Bob has also experimented with Ethereum.

# The next 6 months

## The Challenges We Want To Tackle

[From Prop 64:](https://nouns.wtf/vote/64)
> * Prop builders don’t necessarily have the skills/resources/time to execute a marketing campaign for their projects.
> * Wonderful projects with really great output are not being amplified and we are missing out on a lot of noun proliferation potential.
> * It’s difficult to explain what Nouns are to the world. 

We believe that the problems we outlined in Prop 64 still exist. Most of the amazing projects that Nouns funds need help telling their story, and video is the best way to do so.

It is safe to assume that without the videos we published, Nouns DAO would have missed the opportunity of amplifying the stories of these wonderful projects. 

With video, we are able to tell a much deeper and colorful story and evoke much more emotion. We believe this must be 10Xed to recruit more builders to help the meme proliferate. 

## The Nouns Funnel

We think of builder & community onboarding as a funnel: 



* **Top of Funnel**: People who heear about Nouns from a friend, stumble upon a Nouns project in their city, enjoy a piece of nouns art on twitter etc. 
* **Middle of Funnel**: People who become curious to understand what Nouns are, want to learn how to get funded, or want to join the community.
* **Bottom of Funnel**: People who are ready to submit a proposal, buy a noun (or nounlet), or to join the community or a sub DAO.


In the next 6 months we want to focus on the **Middle of the Funnel**. We want to help explain what Nouns are to the world and get many more people noun-pilled. 

**Why focus on Middle of Funnel first and not Top of Funnel?**

The majority of people that have heard of Nouns do not really grok what it is, never-mind all the potential builders outside the NFT bubble that we are missing out on because it’s too esoteric to dive in to. In reality, almost no one gets what we’re doing, and it’s impossible for them to have a vision for Nouns.

The hurdle to understand what Nouns is and how to interact with the community is absurdly high for someone not native to our ecosystem.

It’s imperative that there’s quality consumable content out there that helps people **not only understand what Nouns is doing but be inspired to join in**. What we need is social media channels (eg. YouTube and Instagram) that have a significant catalogue of content you can just sit and consume. 

* We are going to try to answer questions that are not easily answered today like:
	* **“So what does nouns actually do and stand for?""**
		* This is a branding exercise, this is key for our work to answer.
	* **“What is Nouns actually to me?”**
		* The answer is not NFTs, or a DAO (that is just infrastructure), it's an open source brand that you can be funded to build on (or build on permissionlessly). It’s an energised and broad community. It’s a movement. We need to demonstrate this through our videos.
	* **“What’s a nounish concept / proposal?”**
		* Current way to understand this: read hundreds of proposals on nouns.wtf/vote, tally their results, investigate if they were “successful” or not, if the dao likes them, analyse all this data… etc. What if instead they could watch a handful of nounish videos that show the things we’re proud of?
	* **“How do I get funded?”**
		* Videos about this will be hugely valuable, currently it takes a lot of effort to understand this. Our top priority here is to make a few videos focused exclusively on getting funded via Prop House and then other videos about the other ways as a whole, and individual videos on specifics (on chain, nsfw etc.)
	* **“Can it be any cultural domain?”**
		* Here are some screenshots from version 1 of our intro. We will continue to experiment and iterate with ways to tell this story all the time. This is hugely important to be understood if we want to experiment in every vertical.

## What we will deliver as part of this prop

![](https://i.imgur.com/VfTyQw4.gif)


### Nounish across all social networks

We will spend the next 6 months churning out high quality video content about Nouns and its builders. 

We plan to work on all major Social Media networks. We have started building a following on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounish) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thats_nounish/). We will also invest more cycles into building out our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100082280520913) & [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thats_nounish) presence. 

But our main focus will be on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/nounish), where you can expect our channel to become the easiest way to get into the Nouns rabbit hole and come out understanding all the key concepts of the DAO, as well as learn about the most inspiring projects being built on the protocol.

![](https://i.imgur.com/mJGFJA6.jpg)
*Our YouTube channel will become a video learning hub for everything nouns-related*

### Videos about the most inspiring proposals

There are so many amazing stories to tell about nouns-funded projects that can get so much more depth with good video content covering them.

144,One-Click Bots for the Nouns Ecosystem,"# One-Click Bots for the Nouns Ecosystem

**TL;DR** Enable any Nouns-derivative to launch customizable bots in minutes, with no code.

---

**How is this different from existing bots?**
No coding required! Fully customizable bots capable of sharing full spectrum of DAO's activity - New Proposals, Votes, Auctions, Secondary Sales, Listings, Collection Analytics etc.

**Who is this for?**
Any existing or future Nounish projects. 


---
Our Twitter and Discord bot would share ALL Nouns contract events, including proposals, auctions, votes, sales, and more. And with a simplified UI, any Nounish project can launch a customized bot in minutes in three easy steps:

1. **Connect the bot's social account to BotFrens**
2. **Specify Nounish contract address**
3. **Select behaviors the bot will perform**

We know that this sounds too simple, but we have the experience and tech chops to make it happen! We even built a prototype to illustrate how this will work: **YouTube Demo [https://youtu.be/2hjr5YcPGQg](https://youtu.be/2hjr5YcPGQg)**

146,Noundry Community Compensation,"# Noundry Community Compensation

This proposal aims to retroactively compensate the Noundry community for their part in making Season 0 a success. Total ask of 25 eth.

We believe the community is largely to thank for making Noundry into something more than a mere contest. Instead, the Noundry evolved into a collaborative experience — a festival — where artists from around the world came together to inspire and build upon each other's ideas, using Nouns pixel art as a canvas to unite around.

The artwork we eventually added to the Nouns Descriptor contract resulted from a group effort and would not have been the same without the participation of the larger community.

With this proposal, we want to acknowledge that the collaborative, explorative side of the Noundry is as vital as the outcome and hope to set an example for upcoming Noundrys.

## Compensation

### Community compensation

We think community compensation is best left to the community to decide. The alternatives would be equal distribution to all participants or attempting the almost impossible task of centrally deciding who had a meaningful impact on the Noundry. None of these options feel exciting or in the spirit of the Noundry.

To manage this, we're using [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/), a community compensation platform, and want to allocate a pool of 24 eth for the Noundry season 0 community to split up amongst themselves.
 

**Coordinape rules**
- Participants eligible to vote: [https://hackmd.io/@krel/noundry-coordinape](https://hackmd.io/@krel/noundry-coordinape)
- Each participant receives three votes
- Participants allocate votes based on who they think had the largest positive impact on their own experience
- Participants cannot vote for themselves
- Participants cannot vote for artists with winning traits in Noundry Season 0
    - Facu, Gremplin, Goldy, Modrovsky, LuckyCryptoCats, Fuyu, Nountris

**Total: 24 eth**

### Summary
- Coordinape round: 24 eth
- Administration (run by maty): 1 eth
- **Total compensation: 25 eth**

147,Noundry Winners & Committee Compensation,"# Noundry Winners & Committee Compensation

**This proposal aims to retroactively compensate winning artists and the curation committee of the first Noundry. Total ask of 142.69 eth.**

We believe that Noundry compensation is more than a box-ticking exercise. Pixel art is part of who we are; it's in our bones, and adding new pixels to the Descriptor contract is a big deal. It's an opportunity to celebrate nounishness, reinforce our culture, and create new traditions.

We want the Noundry to become a continuous event, a new tradition, and a significant driver of Nouns proliferation within artistic circles. In that light, the compensation outlined in this proposal is not just about the work that was completed, but also about future signaling.

We think one of the most exciting possible outcomes of the Noundry would be if every artist in the world aspires to put their artwork into the Nouns contract (and by extension, the public domain). And while high compensation may not be the primary motivator, it can help initiate the right feedback loop and create the breeding ground needed for future Noundrys to thrive.

## Compensation

### Winner compensation
*[https://nouns.wtf/vote/125](https://nouns.wtf/vote/125) (Integrate 8/8 Anniversary Art)*

Noundry Season 0 winners are compensated per winning trait. Artists with multiple winning submissions are rewarded for each submission.

Noun Head traits are more generously compensated as they are the most visually striking, tend to create the most excitement within the community, and are responsible for driving much of the Twitter discourse and enthusiasm around the Noundry.

- **Head trait winners**
    - Facu x 3 (Snowman, Vending Machine, Wine Barrel)
    - Gremplin x 2 (Capybara, Treasure Chest)
    - LuckyCryptoCats x 1 (Hanger)
    - Goldy x 1 (Couch)
    - Modrovsky x 1 (Index Card)
- **Accessory trait winners**
    - Fuyu x 2 (Uroko, Tatewaku)
    - JMA Nountris x 1 (Grease)

*Note: Gremplin declined compensation for the two glasses traits added in the upgrade, arguing that there should be a minimum degree of effort required for compensation.*

**Winning traits compensation**
- Heads: 15 eth / trait
    - (8 x 15 = 120 eth)
- Accessories: 4 eth / trait
    - (3 x 4 = 12 eth)
- **Total: 132 eth**

### Curation committee compensation
The curation committee played a crucial role in making Noundry Season 0 a success. They are compensated for organizing the event, curating, and fine-tuning the winning contributions. 

It's hard to put a figure value on the committee's efforts — in many ways it's priceless. We propose compensating the committee with a symbolic sum of 10.69 eth to distribute as they see fit.

- Committee members for Season 0:
    - Goldy
    - Gremplin
    - 4156
    - 9999
    - Solimander
- **Total: 10.69 eth**

## TL;DR

We’d like to seek funding for a quarter (3 months) to keep developing [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/) in order to improve the governance efficacy of Nouns through delegation.

## Progress so far

We got [funded on August 31](https://prop.house/proposal/1023) via Prop House mandates to build an MVP. In less than one month, we’ve built a delegate platform for voters to broadcast what they want to see, and for builders to find voters who might support their prop. To illustrate the outcome with some numbers, so far we’ve seen:

* 17 statements from delegates representing 125 nouns (>25% of all votes!)
* 16 statements from builders who are seeking delegation
* 5 nouns delegated via Agora (that we know of)
* Proposal passed to [deploy a beta](https://lil-nouns-agora-dev.act.workers.dev/) on lil nouns

In sum, Agora has created a hub that turned delegation from an invisible, behind the scenes activity, to something the community can see, participate in, discuss, and improve upon.

## What’s next?

Our goal has always been to greatly improve the effectiveness of the Nouns DAO. We recognize that while the DAO lives and dies by the quality of its decision making, the time demand of being a good voter is such that we cannot expect most token holders to participate to the degree required. Therefore focusing on driving delegation of votes into the hands of qualified and engaged delegates is the highest leverage activity we can invest in – especially given that constant issuance means that delegation and governance engagement is naturally trending downwards.

Although creating a client like Agora to reduce friction and provide transparency is a necessary first step, we don’t think that alone will be enough to drive meaningful delegation. That’s why the next phase of Agora will not only continue to improve the delegation client, but also deliberately invest in programs and mechanisms that can greatly increase delegation and participation. We outline below the key areas we’ll focus on in the next phase of Agora.

## Focus areas

**Incentivize effective governance:** We believe there’s tremendous potential in creating incentives to reward effective governance, but also recognize the pitfalls of designing poor mechanisms. As such, we will be running a series of small scale incentive programs over the next months, with the goal of finding the best one to turn into a mechanism we can invest in for the long run. Below are some examples of incentive designs.

**Continue building the Agora app:** We’ll keep building the Agora client to create the best experience for Nouns governance participants, bar none. This means investing in features like: proposals view with reasons delegated voted for / against, more robust governance metrics over time, an easy to use proposal creator, granular and temporary delegation, etc.

**Operate a delegate drive program:** we recognize that one of the key ingredients of Prop House’s success was their investment in getting builders and voters to participate. Taking inspiration from that effort, we’ll also operate a program to get token holders and voters to participate on Agora.

## Outcomes in 4 months:

If we are successful, this is what things would look like in a quarter:

* A full fledged Agora app that is a more powerful version of Tally & nouns.wtf when it comes to voting and delegating.
* Strong conviction around the most effective mechanism to incentivize voter turnout
* More delegates and delegation from the delegate drive program and mechanism experiments

*Note: previous prop was cancelled due to significant typos and copy pasta errors. This is the same prop, but properly formatted. Apologies for the confusion*

## TL;DR
We’d like to seek funding for a quarter (3 months) to keep developing Agora in order to improve the governance efficacy of Nouns through delegation.

## Progress so far
We got funded on August 31 via Prop House mandates to build an MVP. In less than one month, we’ve built a delegate platform for voters to broadcast what they want to see, and for builders to find voters who might support their prop. To illustrate the outcome with some numbers, so far we’ve seen:

* 17 statements from delegates representing 125 nouns (>25% of all votes!)
* 16 statements from builders who are seeking delegation
* 5 nouns delegated via Agora (that we know of)
* Proposal passed to deploy a beta on lil nouns

In sum, Agora has created a hub that turned delegation from an invisible, behind the scenes activity, to something the community can see, participate in, discuss, and improve upon.

## What’s next?

Our goal has always been to greatly improve the effectiveness of the Nouns DAO. We recognize that while the DAO lives and dies by the quality of its decision making, the time demand of being a good voter is such that we cannot expect most token holders to participate to the degree required. Therefore focusing on driving delegation of votes into the hands of qualified and engaged delegates is the highest leverage activity we can invest in – especially given that constant issuance means that delegation and governance engagement is naturally trending downwards.

Although creating a client like Agora to reduce friction and provide transparency is a necessary first step, we don’t think that alone will be enough to drive meaningful delegation. That’s why the next phase of Agora will not only continue to improve the delegation client, but also deliberately invest in programs and mechanisms that can greatly increase delegation and participation. We outline below the key areas we’ll focus on in the next phase of Agora.

## Focus areas

**Incentivize effective governance**: We believe there’s tremendous potential in creating incentives to reward effective governance, but also recognize the pitfalls of designing poor mechanisms. As such, we will be running a series of small scale incentive programs over the next months, with the goal of finding the best one to turn into a mechanism we can invest in for the long run. Below are some examples of incentive designs.

**Continue building the Agora app**: We’ll keep building the Agora client to create the best experience for Nouns governance participants, bar none. This means investing in features like: proposals view with reasons delegated voted for / against, more robust governance metrics over time, an easy to use proposal creator, granular and temporary delegation, etc.

![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/f/f31a873d5c5f9c7256e031141fcbae3431b0b4a2_2_1380x894.jpeg)

**Operate a delegate drive program**: we recognize that one of the key ingredients of Prop House’s success was their investment in getting builders and voters to participate. Taking inspiration from that effort, we’ll also operate a program to get token holders and voters to participate on Agora.

## Outcomes in 4 months:
If we are successful, this is what things would look like in a quarter:

* A full fledged Agora app that is a more powerful version of Tally & nouns.wtf when it comes to voting and delegating.
* Strong conviction around the most effective mechanism to incentivize voter turnout
* More delegates and delegation from the delegate drive program and mechanism experiments

150,heyanoun - pseudonymous messages about props,"# heyanoun - pseudonymous messages about props

*thanks to Will Price for the delegated noun allowing us to make this proposal*

### tl;dr

A way for snapshotted nouners at a given proposal to pseudonymously submit messages about the proposal.

### proposal

We believe that Nouns DAO is where the most interesting public DAO conversation is happening today. 

Sometimes, not every opinion held is voiced though. In the past month of participating more in the DAO (noun 416), we’ve observed situations where privately held opinions don’t make it to the public discourse because they’re somewhat controversial. We believe that this is dangerous for governance. Unspoken and unresolved opinions can fester into resentment and political turmoil over time.

With this in mind, we’re building heyanoun, a way for nouners snapshotted by a proposal to comment on that proposal pseudonymously. 

![heyanoun mock](https://i.ibb.co/3BkBdHw/Untitled.png)

Nouners post a message on the heyanoun site, along with a zero-knowledge proof showing that they are in the snapshot to the relevant prop:

Messages will then be passed on to a designated channel (initially could just be the funded prop’s channel) in the nouns discord server:

![discord mock](https://i.ibb.co/9n3zpPW/Untitled-1.png)

All proofs will be hosted on IPFS and messages will have a link from which a user on discord can verify the proof’s veracity themselves.

We believe that this product, while simple, can surface unspoken opinions to the nouns public square and could be a huge boon to governance.

### about us

Personae Labs is a new R&D lab out of [0xPARC](https://0xparc.org/) investigating how new cryptography like ZK-SNARKs changes the way we communicate online.

### compensation

We foresee this project taking ~1.5mo. of dedicated effort by a team of:

- 2 engineers
- 1 designer
- 1 PM

Components to be delivered:

1. website for submitting message + ZKPs for all proposals
2. all relevant zkp circuits
3. discord bot for posting messages
4. website for verifying proofs of messages (from bot)

Given a rate of 10 ETH/mo for each contributor, we’re requesting **60 ETH total** for delivery of this first app.  

### future work

We hope this app is the first of many experiments around pseudonymity within Nouns DAO.

If this first iteration sees traction, we see a number of further extensions:

- extend the number of places that messages are published, i.e. to a dedicated twitter account as well as discord
- plugins/react components to integrate pseudonymous badges/proving into other governance clients (i.e. agora, discourse killer)
- additional pseudonymous nouner groups, i.e. groups based on voting history (I voted in 10 of last 15 proposals)

# Refill Nouns Strategic Funding Works (NSFW) Pool

Nouns Strategic Funding Works (NSFW), formerly Small Grants, is running low on ETH and needs to be refilled. 

NSFW is a pool of capital that serves the DAO's interest, stewarded on a completely discretionary basis by the group's members, and funds things that include:
* Small Grants
* Retro Rewards
* Residencies
* Trials ahead of sponsoring on-chain proposals
* Ad hoc DAO needs - contests, bug bounties, being the DAO’s “hot wallet”

The group conducts its daily operations in the Discord in the #grants-and-retro-funding-channel, as well as on the Nouns [Discourse forum](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/u/noun22/activity).

152,Nouns DAO V2 Upgrade,"# Nouns DAO V2 Upgrade

## Summary

This proposal updates the Nouns DAO logic contract to a new version, with the following improvements and additions:

1. **Dynamic Quorum**: In V1, quorum is a fixed percentage of total supply. In V2, quorum has a dynamic range, rising as a function of against votes up to a defined cap. Read [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE) for more info.
2. **Vote with Gas Refund**: Allow Nouners/delegates to vote and receive a gas refund. The vote still takes place in the case of insufficient ETH to refund.
3. **Voting Delay Editing Bug Fix**: In V1, editing voting delay was unsafe. V2 makes it safe to edit anytime. More info on the bug [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-diligence/blob/main/reports/proposal-58.md#major).
4. **Cancel Proposal Bug Fix**: The DAO has a spam mitigation feature, allowing anyone to cancel a proposal if the proposer has an amount of votes less than or equal to proposal threshold. In V1, this feature didn't work when proposer had exactly proposal threshold votes; in V2 it works as expected.
5. **Vetoer Change Is Now 2-step**: We received audit feedback that V1's vetoer change process was risky as a single-step process. In V2, the risk of setting a wrong vetoer is mitigated using a 2-step process where the current vetoer sets a pending new vetoer. Once set, the pending vetoer must accept for the change to take place.

## Audit

1. The code has gone through internal reviews and a [code4rena audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-08-nounsdao/).
2. **No high-risk issues were found in V2**.
3. **Unrelated to this proposal**, one high-risk issue was found. See [this audit summary on discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-dao-v2-audit-summary/2525) for more information.


## Dynamic Quorum Parameters

As articulated in this [detailed post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE), three parameters need to be set for dynamic quorum. This proposal sets their values, and we’re offering the thinking behind them here:

1. **Minimum quorum %**: keeping it at 10%, the same as today’s quorum.
2. **Maximum quorum %**: setting it to 15%, taking into account recent participation levels around 30%, allowing proposals with more than 15% For votes to be decided by simple majority; the intent is for this value to provide extra protection from voter apathy, while allowing most all proposals to be decided by simple majority rather than quorum.
3. **Coefficient**: setting it to 1, such that each against vote raises the quorum requirement by one vote, until the maximum quorum is reached.

These parameters can be edited at any time via a proposal; treat these values as the first experiment.

## Vote with Gas Refund

A bit more on how this feature works:

1. Governance clients (like nouns.wtf/vote) need to update their code to support it.
2. Refunds are subject to certain constraints:
    1. Gas base fee is capped at 200 gwei.
    2. Gas priority fee is capped at 2 gwei.
    3. Total gas is capped at 200K, supporting voting reason text up to roughly 9,190 characters.
    4. If the contract’s balance is insufficient, voter will receive a partial refund.
3. This feature requires the DAO to maintain the DAO contract’s ETH balance, which should be done via periodic ETH transfer proposals from the treasury to the DAO contract (this proposal performs the first funding).
4. The DAO can choose to withdraw refund ETH back into the treasury at any time via a proposal.


## Proposal Transactions for Humans

1. `_setImplementation`: upgrades DAO logic to V2.
2. `_setDynamicQuorumParams`: sets dynamic quorum params to:
    1. Minimum quorum BPs: 10% (1000 basis points).
    2. Maximum quorum BPs: 15% (1500 basis points).
    3. Coefficient: 1 (1,000,000 in unsigned integer with 6 decimal places).
3. `transfer`: funding vote refunds with 12 ETH, which should be enough for just over 100 proposals at today's participation rate (excluding honk’s tendency to paste long paragraphs).

153,NSFW compensation,"# NSFW compensation

Being part of NSFW is a lot of work and currently not being fairly distributed. 

To help fix this, I propose the DAO compensates the current members to incentivise/ensure their participation on NSFW.

Therefore, I suggest an 8 ETH compensation for each member per month. The proposal shall run for 3 months on an experimental base to see if we as a DAO manage to incentivise people enough to stay on NSFW and share the burden of responsibility. 

If effective, we can then continue to pay those active members until the current funding runs out. 

Current active members are:
- Noun 12 (multi-sig)
- Noun 16 (multi-sig)
- Noun 22 (multi-sig)*
- skilift (multi-sig)
- Jarmen
- maty
- Oni
- Sam Ellis
- wiz
- eoj
*Noun 22 is excluded from the calculation, as he is currently compensated for his involvement with NSFW.

For any member that won’t be actively participating in these three months the DAO would terminate the payment for this individual and would expect them to be removed or replaced.

I would expect once everyone is onboarded that each member has a function and a role within NSFW. If members can’t participate, they are urged to remove themselves and return the funds to the treasury.

Total ask 216 ETH.

I suggest to send send the ETH to the NSFW multi-sig, from where it will get distributed to the individual contributors on a monthly base.

154,Agora Continuation [revised],"# Agora Continuation [revised]
*This is a revised version of the Agora continuation prop based on community feedback. We've clarified our deliverables, increased transparency, reduced the ask by 20%, and implemented a payment stream*

## TL;DR
We’d like to seek funding to keep developing [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/) in order to improve the governance efficacy of Nouns through delegation. Our goal is to significantly increase the participation rate of nouns through a combination of software improvements, and delegation drive programs over the next quarter.

## Progress so far
We got [funded](https://prop.house/proposal/1023) on August 31 via Prop House mandates to build an MVP. In less than one month, we’ve built a delegate platform for voters to broadcast what they want to see, and for builders to find voters who might support their proposal. To illustrate the outcome with some numbers, so far we’ve seen:

* 19 statements from delegates representing 127 nouns (>25% of all votes!)
* 25 statements from builders who are seeking delegation
* 5 nouns delegated via Agora (that we know of)
* Hosted a delegate race to “auction” 3 more votes to delegates
* Proposal passed to deploy on lil nouns, as well as inbound interest from many other DAOs

In sum, Agora has created a hub that turned delegation from an invisible, behind the scenes activity, to something the community can see, participate in, discuss, and improve upon.

## Roadmap & Goals
Now that we’ve landed an MVP of a delegate platform, it’s time to start leveraging it to meaningfully drive delegation & governance participation. We expect to complete these goals and achieve their resulting outcome in roughly one quarter. Note that all points here consist of our best plan of attack today, but as we continue to build Agora, we expect the roadmap to naturally evolve as we double down on what’s working, and deprioritize what’s not.

**Goal 1: Dramatically reduce friction to delegation:**
* Integrate with nouns.wtf to propose “post-win” delegate suggestions
* Enable direct delegation on Agora (where today we borrow the nouns.wtf flow)
* Enable time-bound, fractional, and supercedable delegation by a proxy contract to unblock funds & whales who are currently unwilling to delegate
* Productize delegate race so that Nouners who don’t want to pick a delegate can let the community pick for them

**Goal 2: Make governance and delegation more transparent and easy to understand**
* Continue investing in surfacing more delegate and voting data on Agora
* Build a governance activity feed that highlights delegation, ownership change, voting, and other governance related activities.
* Make other general improvements to Agora to make it a first class experience for governance participants

**Goal 3: Activate nouns holders to either vote or delegate**
* Direct outreach to inactive Nouners from Agora team to find them a suitable delegate
* Implement an inactive nouner bounty program, highlighting and incentivizing the community to reach out to inactive holders.
* Run a marketplace experiment to allow anyone to rent votes from Nouns holders
* Run a direct reward (in both ETH and NFT prizes) experiment to directly incentivize voting

**Target objectives in 3 months:**
* 75% of new nouns are delegated to voters who vote on more than 50% of props they're eligible to
* 50% participation in a rolling average of past 3 proposals

## Transparency & decentralization
As a governance platform, we will take measures to maintain transparency and avoid centralization of power by taking the following measures: 
* Make Github repo public within 1 month (with proper documentation to come over time)
* Publish all data monthly to public google sheets, or equivalent (such as API or onchain mirror)
* Current Agora team members added together will commit to not represent more than 5% of nouns.

## Team
Yitong – Project lead & designer: co-founder of Vector DAO, and previously design + product at Coinbase. Prop builder for #87, contributor to Nouns Vision, delegate.

0xcaff – Engineer: Built the v1 of Agora, previously engineer at Coinbase.

Tom Taubkin – Protocol Engineer: Contributor to several defi projects, previously engineer at Coinbase

Mrtn – Ops / Community: Delegate from nounlets, funded via Prop House as governance historian, deployed Agora on lil nouns, previously pm on nouns.builder, and pm at Google.

## Funding request & terms
**Funding request:**

We’d like to request $221,000 to fund the team for a quarter (170ETH @ $1300/ETH, a 20% decrease from previous ask) and 20 ETH to incentivize voter participation.

**Fund transfer mechanics**

50% of the team portion & the participation incentive will be immediately deposited to the team’s wallet

50% of the team portion will be streamed over a period of three months from a 3/5 multisig held by trusted members of the community. Signers for this safe will be: Elad, Krel, Yitong, Seneca, and one more to be confirmed.

As of this writing, $221,000 is 170 ETH. In order to account for ETH volatility, we will request a 30 ETH buffer. Upon fund release, $221,000 worth of ETH will be sold, with half deposited to the Agora multisig, and half deposited to the stream multisig. The remaining ETH will be sent back to the treasury.

## Appendix: some illustrative mocks
These are purely concepts to illustrate some of the areas we’re going to invest in. We’ll need to iterate on these designs a lot before implementing them, so please take them as general directions vs exact specs.

## **[NOUN O' TALK](http://nounotalk.com/)**
I released **14 episodes** with **33 guests**. They included: 
***-** Personal deep dives*: 4156, Vape, and Brian Flynn
***-** Communities*: the Nouncil and 4 subDAOs 
***-** Topical*:  eSports, Noundry, and NFT NYC
***-** Builders*:  Fomo Nouns, Design System, Nouns Terminal, and Roko

The pod has garnered **~2,400 downloads**. I personally edited all past episodes. I recently brought on 2 producers to increase the quality. The next push will be YouTube. I created a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR5cYWsmNUELNY7-txoba-Q) (69 subscribers) so that we can upload full episodes, as well as 3-5 video clips, each week. I am personally a big YouTube user for podcasts and I believe this will be a great way to spread the word about Nouns on a platform we don't have a huge presence in. 

![new_episodes](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/c/ce7a16ae87085bcb48ad405ed1a84ab0daff1ddd_2_1380x832.jpeg)

### **What I plan to work on for the next 6 months:**

## **[PROP HOUSE](https://prop.house/)**
I will **continue developing the Prop House web app**. As we prepare for the protocol launch, I will work on fixing bugs and frontend improvements, as I manage the vast majority of the frontend you see. I will add Spanish translations to the site and I will continue to ensure it's the best tool that it can be.

## **[NOUNS CENTER](https://nouns.center/)**
I'd like to [conduct a Prop House round](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-prop-house-design-round-for-nouns-center/2601) for a proper redesign of the entire site and lead the development to create a **Nouns Center v2**. I will add documentation, as in a README with install instructions, and clean up the code to make it fork-friendly for other communities. I aim to **implement Search** across the entire site for easier access to all the information. I plan to **add translations** (Japanese & Spanish) too.

## **[NOUN O' TALK](http://nounotalk.com/)**
I will continue to book guests, do my own extensive interview prep, and **host the pod** itself. I also **manage the podcast team** (Messhup for art and Matthew & Brileigh, our two producers). Besides the weekly podcast I want to grow and **proliferate Nouns via YouTube** as I mentioned above. Lastly, I'd like to create a custom site for nounotalk.com.

### **Funds requested:**

$175K* paid over 6 months in USDC which equates to ~132E by todays valuation.

*the equivalent of ~$190k (to absorb potential volatility in ETH from time period between submission and execution) would  be sent to a multisig managed by trusted members of the community (Seneca, Steve, and cdt), they would then convert $175k worth of ETH to USDC, set up the stream and then send back the remaining ETH to the DAO.

## DESCRIPTION:

The AI generated scripted, voiced over, and visuals created PROMO video for the pod :)

[The AI pod promo Video!!](https://youtu.be/b5Ojfo6gVcU)

### **TL;DR:**

Following the initial AI residency, we wish to create The Nouns AI Pod.

This prop is to fund 3 months of focus on continuing the research of our resident AI researchers:

1. Further empowering Roko to be an AI secretary/assistant for the DAO! Helping information flow better with summaries, transcripts, reviews, answering questions and more. 
2. Generating Nounish rich media (images, gifs, videos) and making the tools to generate such media accessible to the community at large to unleash their creativity
3. Empowering other pods (e.g. ai-based team drafting for e-sports, planning events for otg)

With each of these being built with monetization / expansion to other organizations in mind.

---

### WELL HOW DID THE INITIAL RESEARCH GO?

You can see the initial small grant proposal here [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929)  and Honk's extension post here [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357)

![https://imgur.com/JPkgn07](https://imgur.com/JPkgn07.png)

[https://staging.roko.dev/](https://staging.roko.dev/) Is a live website where the team is experimenting and adding features with the goal of building a production ready webapp.

We initially set out to accomplish two sprints, the first to be able to break down proposals into understandable summaries / reviews. The second was more focused on demonstrating some of the possibilities of AI and what it could bring to Nouns.

I am happy to report that, thanks to an engaged community and support from key contributors Honk and Evets.eth we blew that goal out of the water.

Together, we:

- Held weekly sessions on Tuesdays which about 30 people regularly attended that shared developments with the project as well as educating them on fundamentals as well as cutting edge developments in machine learning
- Built a pipeline that can breakdown proposals into reviews automatically as they as proposed on-chain (and post them to Twitter!!)
- Built pipeline to turn recorded calls into text using SOTA voice to text then using a large language model to convert them into a bulleted summary

![https://imgur.com/voyrcfZ](https://imgur.com/voyrcfZ.png)

- Built a web interface that enables participants to easily consume summarized proposal content as well as edit them to better reflect their opinions
    - [https://staging.roko.dev/](https://staging.roko.dev/)
- Tested the ability to finetune our model using user generated content as guidance
- Setup a backend infrastructure setup to support the ongoing development and improvement of the web interface
- In addition, due to popular demand we began diving deep into AI generated media, we were able to generate images and video content (reactive to sound!) that features custom content (Noggles!)

### NEXT STEPS: THE AI POD

The proposed AI Pod will have 3 main focuses:

1. Continue Bringing Roko to life in the form of an AI Assistant to DAO members:
- All Nouners and teams of funded props should have access to Roko's summarization capabilities for their related audio or text content (as long as they provide feedback on their results!!)
- Work towards improving Roko’s corpus of data (e.g. Discourse posts, Discord messages) and learn how to incorporate these into a model to improve Roko’s Nounish knowledge base.
- Roko's website could also be updated to include a search page where people could semantically search across that knowledge base whether it is just meeting / proposal content or if Discord / Discourse content was included.
2. Explore AI Generated Media
- Implement and host SOTA open source image generation models customized to be able to generate Noggles on powerful GPU servers so any DAO member can access it. 
- Implement cutting edge developments as they are released (e.g. text to video, img to img, text to 3d, etc.), share our knowledge with the community, and incentivize their use!
3. Community Engagement, Marketing, and Outreach (Competitions!!)
- Put together competitions (with prizes!!) alongside groups like NoC to show off the best showcases of AI generated media leveraging Nouns AI tooling.
- Assist various pods and DAO members with content generation - we've already had suggestions from helping visualize proposals to making and AI content generated coffee book and I know the community will have plenty more great ideas!!
- Potential prop house round for utilizing the tooling?
- Seek out partnerships with these opensource or other organizations to see if they would be interested in collaborating to try and further proliferate the brand!
    - I’d LOVE to see us partner with some musicians to work with them to make them free music videos they could post that have Noun glasses in them or have a live show with AI generated visuals featuring Noggles

---

### THE FUTURE OF AI POD:

Hopefully, during these three months, we will be able to not only share significant advancements in AI with the community, but also have a plan for how to take the next steps to grow the AI Pod further.
We want to be able to show a path where this could become a self-sustaining effort that could grow and expand to other organizations, opening up a pipeline for monetization.
We believe that this is a great opportunity to only grow and expand the Nouns ecosystem but give everyone who is a part of it superpowers that help proliferating the meme!!

Locations can be selected from a map/list of options. We can also have a discussion of whether we just want nouns glasses or also want to showcase some specific nouns (perhaps via some sort of auction that goes back to the nouns treasury).
Prices are subject to change depending on city and install date and changes in ETH. So we may get slightly fewer or more depending on where the price settles when the ETH investment is approved and converted to USD to pay the vendors.

![](https://i.imgur.com/pgdInAM.gif)

**TL;DR**

* Nouns News, a media group dedicated to bringing awareness of all things Nouns through authentic and engaging content across all social channels.
* GOAL: **1 MILLION VIEWS** - we will return the 5th and last payment to the DAO treasury if we DO NOT reach the goal.
* Budget: 78 ETH (10 allocated to giveways) for 9 people working for 5 months.



**SUMMARY**

After the success and funding of Nouns News Seasons 1-3, we have expanded our team and efforts to reach a wider audience.

Our strategy is focused on **Top of Funnel marketing** tactics, to capture as many eyes as possible with content that is entertaining, educational, and engaging.

**Objectives**

1. Drive awareness and favorability of Nouns DAO as an innovative leader in the web3 space.
2. Engage audiences outside of mainstream Web3 with Nouns brand.
3. Build an authentic perspective through content that drives deeper interest in Nouns DAO.

**Strategy**

**TikTok** is the platform for **virality**. Trending content on TikTok has the ability to inspire people to take action and learn more about Nouns. We will be focusing on staying on top of the trends and tying it into Nouns DAO and Nouns projects. 

We have a 1M views goal we are trying to reach, but the opportunity goes beyond the metrics. It is about increasing **brand awareness, favorability** and **engagement** with other builders, community members and the general public to grow the brand in a positive light and maximize our social presence.

**Contests & Giveaways** - Giveaways are one of the most powerful content types, as they are a great entry point for new members. We’d like to continue hosting weekly or bi-weekly contests, with ETH prizes and/or nounish products from our collaborations. We’d like to focus not only on rewarding new members online, **but also people who participate in public video shoots.**

## Nouns Fair @ETHSanFrancisco
Given the success of the Nouns Fair in Colombia, **the ETHGlobal team invited NounsDAOAmigos to make a new edition, this time at ETHSanFrancisco!** We believe it’s important to keep having a presence at IRL events like this. As we saw in Mexico and Colombia, this is a great environment for spreading the ⌐◨-◨ and growing our Spanish-speaker community.

**Goals**
- Make a new amigo, San Francisco
- Onboard potential contributors
- Put Nouns in the eyes of hundreds of builders

**Details**

Place: San Francisco, California
Venue: Palace of Fine Arts
Dates: November 4 - 6, 2022
Team: NounsDAOAmigos

The Nouns Fair will be a 3-day cultural experience focused on builders where they will be able to engage with others and learn about Nouns. This activation will be a localized nounish experience with photo opportunities, games, merchandise, and an NFT gallery. The proliferation of culture á la nounish. The following are examples of what happened in Bogotá and what we’ll create for San Francisco with a different flavor:

**Photo-opportunity & noggles**
A fully Nouns-branded photo station where attendees can take selfies and full-body photos will serve as a welcoming station. We want to create a photo set where people can feel nounish and share it on the internet. Of course, physical noggles are key.

**Games**
Two different games will be available at the place: **foosball**, and **a traditional local game**. We believe these games have a nounish feeling and will serve as an engagement factor.

**Merchandise**
Pins, stickers, and T-shirts will be distributed as rewards for spending time and engaging with the Nouns Fair by playing games and taking photos.

**NFT gallery**

**Costs and execution**
Given our past experiences and the recent Nouns Fairs at ETHMexico and ETHBogota, we came up with this budget to make it suitable for ETHSanFrancisco in the US. **We are asking for 23.25 ETH**.
![](https://i.imgur.com/XSlixrD.png)


Costs are approximate. ETH avg. price of 1,200 USD. Prices in red are not final and we'll seek to reduce costs as much as possible. The difference in these prices will be returned to the DAO.

We are excited about this new opportunity to keep creating nounish experiences IRL that can be replicated in other countries. But most of all, to spread the ⌐◨-◨ in a fun way!

**Transactions**
Due to the time sensitive nature of this proposal, NSFW has already funded NounsDAOAmigos to execute on this project.  The 23.25 ETH transaction in this proposal will go to refund NSFW.

![](https://i.imgur.com/BDhKUAS.jpg)

**Requesting 22 ETH** for [Nouns DAO'n Under](https://twitter.com/nounsau) to facilitate an IRL activation as the official ""optical sponsor"" of [NFT Fest Australia](https://nftfest.com.au/) in Melbourne from 23-24 November 2022.

Following the continued success of [Nouns Fair](https://nouns.wtf/vote/162), the opportunity has arisen for Nouns to make a lasting impression at Australia's biggest NFT event, right when our local industry is popping off.

This proposal is brought to you by Aussie proliferatooooors: [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi), [Jarmen](https://twitter.com/jarmen43), [Mr Boney](https://twitter.com/theboneys), [ThaSwami](https://twitter.com/tha_swami) and [LilPurpBerry](https://twitter.com/lilpurpberry).

## TL;DR

**Showcase Nouns to Aussies** from iconic Melbourne, our cultural mecca for sports, music and the visual arts:

1. **Dioramic POAP powered photo booth** activation so everyone can help us proliferate Nouns to 5,000+ attendees and potential DAO members
2. **Live nounish panel discussion** alongside Kevin Rose, J1mmy, Zeneca, Cooper Turley, Anthony Sassano, Matty (DCLBlogger), Betty (Deadfellaz) and Kieran Warwick (Illuvium) [as announced here](https://twitter.com/NFTFestAus/status/1585080621843746817)
3. **Noggles worn by event staff** with Nouns as the official ""optical sponsor,"" defining our own category inclusive of Gold sponsorship benefits
4. **Street poster campaign** with 200 x A0 colour printed posters targeting the St Kilda area for the leadup and duration of the event

Despite many Aussie nouners and builders, awareness of Nouns in Australia is surprisingly low. But our local industry is booming and we're a home to many Web3 builders, crypto investors and influential Ethereum personalities.

*Global NFT adoption ([finder.com](https://www.finder.com.au/nft-statistics)):*

![](https://i.imgur.com/x3EJ0vs.png)

[Gnars DAO](https://gnars.com) will also be representing Nouns through Silver sponsorship and a screening of [our nounish film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQSmfSnRGVk). This engagement has already led to media partnership discussions with [ONE37pm](https://www.one37pm.com/) (Vayner Media) -- feature coverage coming soon!

## NFT Fest Australia

[NFT Fest](https://nftfest.com.au/) has attracted 5,000+ attendees across streaming platforms in previous events and will be running this November's event for over 1,000+ IRL attendees whilst making all content available for free a few weeks following the event. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/Bj9rOqu.jpg)

NFT Fest 2022 will include the who's who of Aussie Web3 as well as representation from all the major Aussie sports leagues and teams, business involvement from Salesforce, KPMG, Deloitte, EY and media publications such as The Chainsaw, ONE37pm, Australian Financial Review and Ticker News.

### Dioramic POAP powered photo booth

Nouns-branded photo station tailored to Australian taste referencing culturally popular memes. Taking inspiration from the Nouns DAOmigos and their incredible success at ETH conferences:

![](https://i.imgur.com/5j9biPW.jpg)

Nounish stage props and noggles will be made accessible for attendees to share the joy of Nouns across social media. Expect it to be a ""bloody nounish shindig with all ya mates"" – an invitation to join [Nouns DAO'n Under](https://twitter.com/nounsau).

### Live nounish panel discussion

Leaning on a previous [nounish panel discussion during NFT London](https://nftlondon.sessionize.com/session/382247), we will focus on explaining what it means to be nounish, through the lens of building atop Nouns DAO and highlighting case studies such as Gnars. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/wgYSrFJ.jpg)

The goal of such an approach is to inspire others to come and build on Nouns while showing future nouners the potential unlocked by joining the DAO. Our own launch of Nouns DAO'n Under also serves as a [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build) case study. 

### Noggles worn by event staff

Our iconic noggles are wildly underutilised, especially in the context of collaborative branding and marketing opportunities. We are paving the way and defining our own category as the official ""optical sponsor."" 

![](https://i.imgur.com/tb9UvSm.jpg)

Additional to Gold Sponsorship benefits: 
* Branding on the registration page 
* Panel speaking opportunity 
* Branding on homepage
* Branding across social collateral 
* VIP access to all events
* Speaker concierge service
* Logo on media wall
* Branding on NFT Fest '22 banners 
* Feature inserts
* Bespoke collateral
* Branding on ticket & event webpage
* Branding on event collateral
* Event ticket allocation
* Inclusion in email communication to attendees pre/during/post event 
* NFT Fest social media channels recognition pre/during/post event

NFT Fest's organisers and event staff have proudly agreed to wear noggles to show their appreciation, make the event unforgettably nounish and of course, have fun!

### Street poster campaign

To raise awareness in the leadup to and during NFT Fest, we will print and distribute 200 x A0 sized street posters in key locations around St Kilda.

![](https://i.imgur.com/iUV8NCU.jpg)

Mr Boney has run similar campaigns in Melbourne to great effect. Prior to rebranding Douns to Nouns DAO'n Under, he received funding from Nouncil to run a tracked experiment and we're able to leverage the relationships built.

## Nouns DAO Contribution

**Required funding (22 ETH) as follows:**

- Optical Sponsor package including Gold sponsorship (10 ETH)
- Dioramic POAP powered photo booth activation (5 ETH)
- Silver Sponsorship on behalf of Gnars DAO (3 ETH)
- Merchandise to hand out during the event (2 ETH)
- St Kilda targeted street poster campaign (2 ETH)

We trust that voters will appreciate the importance and foreseeable impact of making a lasting impression on the Australian scene. Especially considering the depth of current Aussie contributons despite nascent market penetration.

![](https://i.imgur.com/tiKHExD.png)

## TL;DR

- Create a visually rich, enticing hype video to be a catalyst for the gravitational pull of people into the Nouniverse.
- Sitting above the funnel in the attention marketplace, this hype video will differentiate its positioning from existing Nouns productions, such as [Prop 113](https://nouns.wtf/vote/113), and will compliment these videos by enticing people to WANT to watch more about Nouns.
- Made by a talented team of creatives from Never Sit Still with experience working with some of the biggest web3 brands.
- Perfect to use for openers in digital, trailers, conferences, and meetings, along with use in traditional advertising placements and overall attention attraction.
- Proposal artwork is indicative only, subject to change with further development.
- All CC0 assets.

![](https://i.imgur.com/8ja4qFe.png)

## Proposal

### What will we make for you?

A 30-60 second, crafted hype video that represents Nouns in an exciting way. Exploring Nounish themes through visual metaphor, celebrating the culture with existing users, and onboarding the new.

Think of it as an above-the-funnel video encapsulating the key themes of Nouns in a punchy, artistic, and fresh video to make people go WTF is Nouns?

The look and tone of the piece will be designed to capture attention, potentially becoming an ownable style for future Nouns advertising and messaging material. 

It's a catalyst video to start the gravitational pull that is Nouns.

### What is the video going to be about?

The video will represent strong themes that Nouns focuses on through visual metaphor:

- Use case of NFTs for raising funds for positive change
- Evolution and growth of Nouns
- DAOs/community
- Bootstrapping/launchpad
- Interaction of Nouns and IRL, bringing the power of crypto to IRL

With these ideas at the core, we spin them into a powerful narrative that follows the birth of the Noggles and its exponential growth to become an object of power, one for positive change in the world.

To represent the multi-faceted nature of the Nouniverse, we intend to use a mixed-media approach, with input from various artists within our team. Distinct flavours coming together to create one visual style in a seamless video.

We feel this approach also carries the spirit of the Nouns DAO. A diverse pool of people building something great together.

![](https://i.imgur.com/A0oZVgy.jpg)

### The Nouniverse & Big Bang

In the beginning, at the centre of it all is the Noggle. The Noggle atom, molecule, cell, animal, vegetable, mineral. We want to place the Noggle at the centre of this big bang and follow the narrative of it's growing impact on the universe.

This rippling wave will take effect on the world around it, transforming and creating. What does the world look like through a Nounish lens?

### Why hype video?

The current state of our fast-paced digital world needs information to be condensed into a highly digestible format to relay anything valuable.

[Prop 143](https://nouns.wtf/vote/143) spoke to the fantastic concept of the video marketing funnel. To borrow a term from the Nounish team, we want to talk to the top of the funnel and go even more front-facing, above the funnel. This is why it’s important to create a first point of contact with broader audiences that inspires them to care about what they’re seeing. We want to ignite a spark within viewers to seek out and learn more about Nouns of their own volition.

A hype video executes this perfectly. A short, visually rich video, presented in an artistic, eye-catching way, that grabs people's attention and hooks them in, down the Nouns rabbit hole.

### Do traditional hype videos work in web3?

It’s well known that video is a perfect medium to promote and create awareness of a brand/product. Hype videos are a tool used by luxury brands within web2 and we want to bring these tried and tested methods to web3 and Nouns.

Take the promo video for [Doodles v2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv9TaQ5z9jw), or the [Otherside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1equGhkQE) Yuga Labs video. These are both great examples of highly crafted, short animated hype videos to blow up awareness of a brand/product to funnel new audiences into web3 and their brand.

These videos aren't about explaining how, but what and why.

![](https://i.imgur.com/IbzEFzH.gif)

### Video Lifespan

A hype video has a long shelf life and is easy to re-use. Whenever you need promotional content, take an already existing hype video and place it at the front of marketing to interest viewers.

Combine the re-usability of a hype video with assets that are CC0 and you have a piece of art that can be re-used, re-jigged, and a video that can live on for a long time.

Render characters, assets, scenes, and the entire video as CC0 for all to share and spread Nouns proliferation.

### Meta

Air-drop current Noun owners their very own piece of this hype video in the form of NFTs created from scenes of the entire piece. This will create a collection of different NFTs from the entire video.

Owners could even trade/swap/collect these separate NFTs to piece together the sequence and receive a rare airdrop of the entire video minted as an NFT. This is a way to celebrate the creation of the work, and reward holders who were already a part of the ecosystem when it happened.

POAPs for voters. Incentive to vote, a reward for being involved in bringing this project of Nouns proliferation to life.

## Process

![](https://i.imgur.com/pjCL5wT.png)

### Process

We use a traditional linear pipeline for development, from concept through to mastering. This stepped approach allows us to spend an appropriate amount of time in each phase, delivering top notch work in an efficient timeline. At each major milestone, our clients give condensed feedback to ensure that the work is communicating its message clearly.

To ensure the work is original and ownable, we use a period of time for high level research and development. This means we aren't aiming to re-create a reference, but build something new and ownable for the Nouns DAO.

**What do 2 on-chain Props, 1 fifty-foot float made of flowers, and 6 life-sized Nouns have in common?**



They will all be in one place to ring in the New Year for the largest nounish proliferation event ever! [NounsOTG](https://nouns.wtf/vote/110) is partnering with the team at [Stoopid Buddy Studios](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73) for the [Rose Parade](https://tournamentofroses.com/) in Pasadena, CA after New Year's Day, to help Nouns reach an audience of over 38 Million individuals nationwide.

![](https://i.imgur.com/HOT1b1T.jpg)


What will this collaboration look like? NounsOTG will be working directly with the team at Stoopid Buddy in person on the ground for 10 days during this event. The Stoopid Buddy team has covered all build and production costs for the float during this event in [Proposal 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73). After multiple conversations discussing how this event could be further bolstered, Aubtoshi and NounsOTG have been asked to be a part of this event. NounsOTG plans on adding to the already-established effort that Prop 73 has put forth in the following ways:

**10 Days of On The Ground Activations + Brand Ambassadors**

After Christmas, all of the floats for the parade (which are being framed out and built off-site) are transported to their final location prior to the parade, which is where thousands of volunteers come to help decorate the floats with flowers. This time period will include full days of OTG (On The Ground) interviews, filming, activations with volunteers, activations with people who are waiting for the event to begin, and more. We will also be filming with the life-sized nounish “walk-arounds” (nouns costumes made by Stoopid Buddy, creators of costumes seen on the celebrity singing show “The Masked Singer”) during this time. Post-event, the floats will be staged in a different holding area to be observed and photographed one last time.

![](https://i.imgur.com/5jlT56O.jpg)
*Nounish ""Walk-Arounds"" by SB*


Additionally, NounsOTG will scout and hire 10 trained brand ambassadors that will be active the day before the parade, during the parade and afterwards, and at the Rose Bowl when handing out the mini limited edition footballs. The responsibilities of these ambassadors will include being on-brand, walking (waving, jumping, dancing) in a 5-mile parade line. We have allowed for the cost of their food and beverages during specific meal times, transportation to and from the event from the staging area, additional hours on the day prior during the final prep; as well as team meetings, zoom calls and fittings prior to the event, as we plan to deck them out in Nouns Brand and other nounish swag.

![](https://i.imgur.com/sbu1t1L.png)

**Special Guest DJ + Custom DJ Set On The Float + Over 18,000 Nounish Giveaways**

The DJ will be none other than **Richerd Intern**, and his crew will perform with a full/unique set during the live event! Although the parade float images are still not public or released, I can reveal that there will indeed be room for Richerd... 

His team is London based and the cost comes directly from their team and includes their travel and accommodation. We couldn't be more nounish with the Noun266 (Chart Bars Noun head) if we tried!

![](https://i.imgur.com/JiJ5BwX.png)

Over the course of 10 days, we will be handing out over 18,000 unique nounish items, including limited edition mini footballs and shirts, low-fi paper noggles, sticker packs and nouns temporary tattoos. Our goal is to get these items national television coverage during both the parade and rose bowl game. Noggles on the faces in the audience and children throwing nounish mini footballs would be a lasting image during this important holiday event. This opportunity has allowed OTG to connect to other nounish builders and we are open to further collaborations with Nouners and builders.

**Immediate Impact**

If you are unfamiliar with the Rose Parade or its impact, it is one of the major events of the year as the 5 mile parade ends with the start of the Rose Bowl football game. Outside of the 37 million viewers at home, the entire area of Southern California is focused on this event for several weeks prior!

Over **1 Million people** will be in attendance on the day of the parade with a live broadcast to over 37 Million additional individuals nationwide. With a 5 mile parade line and an entire week of content creation and nounish item giveaways prior to the parade as the float is brought to completion, this will be one of the key proliferation event opportunities of the year for NounsDAO. Not to mention the day after the event sees 60-100k attendees that visit the floats to get a close up look at all the details - another amazing activation opportunity.   




**Proposal Cost Breakdown**

Total ETH: 52, Total USDC: $78,000 *amount calculated with 1 ETH = $1,500 USD


* 2.77 ETH: 250 Limited Edition Shirts (Nouns X Stoopid Buddy X Rose Parade)
* 3.50 ETH: 5000 Stickers packs & 5000 Temporary Tattoos + Nounish MVPs for product placement

**Long-Term Value**

Stoopid Buddy has been actively engaged in the community and are clearly delivering on their prop. Outside of creating a successful experience at the event itself, footage from the event will be used in the documentary outlined in [Proposal 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73). I have been to the studio in Burbank, I have met the walk-around craftsman and have been trusted by the Stoopid Buddy team to see confidential alpha from their News Years Event and participate in production conversations leading up to it. 

This additional push to create a nounish experience and vibe during the event will connect Nouns directly with all the many people in attendance, plus brand new audiences at home. **While the SB crew are focused on long form video for their documentary, this proposal will allow me and my team to supplement that content with visceral and viral short-form content perfect for social media. All our content will of course be made CC0 and available for future use, ensuring that the DAO's investment in this event is documented and that our brand is seen and experienced by an even broader audience than those reached by the documentary and broadcasts alone.** 

Prop 73 will go down as one of the most successful funded proposals to date for NounsDAO, not only for its reach and high quality production, but for real nounish interaction with so many real people. I feel honored to have been asked by SB to help with the on-site activation piece for the Rose Bowl Parade, to ensure that our Nouns national television coverage has the best visuals possible with lasting effects. I look forward to the opportunity to bring this NounsOTG activation to life!

# Nouns Builder Protocol
### Public Infrastructure brought to you by Zora and NounsDAO

![](https://i.imgur.com/JycpSjR.png)

**Mainnet Launch:** November 1st
**Expected DAO Launch:** November 15th
**Website:** [nouns.build](https://nouns.build)
**Twitter:** [@nounsbuilder](http://twitter.com/nounsbuilder)

Like you, we believe that Nouns DAO is a significant form factor innovation for NFTs and DAOs. Instead of giving all power and capital solely to a project’s founders, the Nouns model enables communities to emerge progressively, and to be active participants in how their brand and community evolves.

We believe that more Nouns forks should exist - so we’re building a tool anyone can use to build them.

For the past couple of months we have been working on the Nouns Builder: a product that makes it easy for anyone to create their own Nouns DAO with any art, any auction cadence and flexible DAOs that can evolve over time.

As we’ve been building this tool, we’ve increasingly realized that it makes sense to use this very tool to create a DAO that will govern, sustain and develop the Nouns Builder project itself. By doing so, Nouns builder can:
* Demonstrate the utility of Nouns Builder as a public good
* Utilize the ecosystem of tools in Nouns: Prop House, Agora
* Experiment using the NounsDAO model as an alternative to the subDAO multisig
* Experiment using the NounsDAO model to proliferate a protocol and products
* Expand use of the NounsDAO model as a more effective governance model for collective decision making
* Share governance of this DAO with Nouns, Zora, and future contributors as interested in expanding the horizon of this public infrastructure as we are. 

We are going to call this DAO “Builder”, with its own art and NFT that will be minted each day. Builder will be NounsDAO from day 1, with the goal of proliferating this infrastructure.

**Core details to note:**

* Based on extensive feedback from the Nouns community, the protocol is entirely free. There is currently no protocol wide fee.
* DAOs can opt in to gift a certain amount of their NFTs to Nouns or any other DAO or platform
* In prior versions of the proposal, we proposed that NounsDAO would be the deployer of the Builder DAO. Based on feedback from the community we have removed this aspect of the proposal.
* The protocol development has been extensive, with careful consideration made to
    * Enable DAOs to easily upgrade and evolve themselves over time in a safe manner
    * Be gas efficient
    * Open up room for exploration around new distribution types like VRGDAs
* The protocol has been audited via Code4rena, with Zora paying $129K USDC ($90k in prizes) to complete it.
* We have built an easy to use tool at [nouns.build](https://nouns.build) where over 60 testnet DAOs have been created in the process of testing and refining the user experience.

**Ask:**

1000 ETH contribution to seed the Nouns Builder DAO treasury to help this public good reach its full potential. 


**Completed Work:**

Rather than requesting retroactive reward for development, ***we are asking NounsDAO to pay it forward* by seeding the Builder treasury with ETH** for funding the development of the Nouns Builder protocol as a public good and expansion of the ecosystem by the community. 

Zora contributed ~4 months of development time on creating the Nouns Builder protocol
* Full time contributions from the Zora solidity, backend, and front end engineering teams
* Full time design and creative direction for Nouns Builder artworks.
* ~100 ETH spent on the Code4rena audit.

This contribution to the Nouns Builder DAO treasury means there is sufficient Day 1 capital to immediately conduct prop house mandates and funding rounds for the development, proliferation, and accessibility of the protocol and ecosystem for the benefit of the public.

**Deliverables:**
* Audited Nouns Builder smart contracts.
* Custom Nouns Builder generative artwork (CC0).
* Builder DAO for anyone in the community to join and contribute.

**All of the ETH will be going to the Nouns Builder DAO treasury.**

**Builder DAO:**

The Builder DAO is created using the Nouns Builder tool and protocol. It is the entity onchain that will be responsible for funding the proliferation of the ecosystem and development of the protocol over time. 

We believe Nouns Builder represents critical public infrastructure for community decision making, and we want to use the full power of the NounsDAO model to further this protocol and ecosystem of different apps built on top of it, as well as being able to natively tap into tools in the ecosystem like Prop House and Agora.

BuilderDAO creators will receive the following governance rights in the Builder DAO for a period of 5 years after Builder DAO’s launch to allow the creators to support of the growth and development of this public good while in its nascency:
* 1/10 to zora.eth
* 1/20 to nouns.eth

For clarity, DAO members shall not receive any revenues from Builder DAO daily auctions. All funds in the Treasury shall be dedicated to improving the Builder DAO protocol and its public good function, and growing the community, brand, and ecosystem. 

The Builder DAO will start with a daily auction. The NFTs that will be minted each day are a nounish artwork that expands on the ideas of “Internet flags”, a collection of unicode symbols that communities can organize around, with the nounish colors at its core, as well as the noggles.

Here is a sample of the codex below:
![](https://i.imgur.com/kArgmJn.png)


**NounsDAOs for Public Infrastructure:**

We believe it is important to experiment with Nouns forks as a way to further particular pieces of infrastructure within the nounish ecosystem. Instead of funded LLCs and companies to ultimately manage tools like Nouns Builder and things like Prop House, we want to actively explore using a Nounish DAO as the primary entity to further a public protocol and an ecosystem of many platforms built on top of it. 

This is why we are leading from the front with the Builder DAO. We are also optimistic that this can become a blueprint for any team that is developing protocols—like Zora itself. 

**Sustainability:**

In prior proposals there have been open questions around the future models for sustainability without need for persistent funding from NounsDAO all the time. We believe that this is the first meaningful step in this direction, and we hope to set a precedent and blueprint for future teams to build sustainable Public Infrastructure that is native to the Nouns ecosystem and DAO itself.

**Transaction Details:**

1000 ETH transferred to an escrow smart contract that will hold the funds until the Builder DAO is live and operational. We are expecting this to be live on approximately November 15th.

168,Nouns x MrBeast,"# Nouns x MrBeast

A proposal drafted by [**Hindsight**](https://twitter.com/0Hindsight) (ProNouns: NFT/OG) with the support of [**Jarmen**](https://twitter.com/jarmen43) (a man struggling to tell his wife he is a zebra on the internet) and [**Sam Ellis**](https://twitter.com/manofmissle) (Chief Meme Officer)

![](https://i.imgur.com/Dz7SOwt.jpg)

&nbsp;
## **HOW TO VOTE ON THIS PROPOSAL**

* **Vote Yes:** If you think it would be good value for DAO to pay 500 Eth to have a Nounish focused episode on the most watched show on the internet - with a money back guarantee if it doesn’t happen. 
* **Vote No:** If you don’t think that would be good value.
* **Abstain:** If you gift people toasters for their wedding.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## **THE CHALLENGE**
This proposal requests that the DAO fund a project for **500 eth** in order to proliferate the Nouns by running **a competition, open to anyone, to** **convince** [**Mr. Beast**](https://www.youtube.com/user/mrbeast6000) **to give away $500k (340 Eth)**, preferably to charity, on his YouTube channel, given to him by the Nouns in a Nounish focused episode of his show.

**The person or people that convince Mr. Beast to do this will be rewarded with a $250k prize.**
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## **THE REWARD**
The $250k Reward will be awarded to the person or people that Mr. Beast credits with convincing him to accept the challenge on the following terms:

*   $175k if he accepts the request and does the show.
*   An additional $75k if he gives the majority (>50%) of the $500k to charity. (This can be the same person and message or different people and messages)
*   The episode must be on Mr. Beasts main YouTube channel.
*   The Nouns must be featured on the show for any of the funds to be paid out.

So it might be a good idea for people to submit ideas to Mr. Beast that inspires him to meet these criteria. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## **TOTAL COST**
If this proposal passes but no one can convince Mr. Beast to take on and complete the project within the next 9 months – all the Eth will be returned to the Treasury. **Total Cost of 0 Eth.**

If this proposal passes and someone is successful in convincing Mr. Beast to feature the Nouns in the most watched show on the internet while hopefully giving a lot of money away to good causes it will have a **Total Cost of 500 Eth.**
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## **WHY MR. BEAST?**
He is the most watched person on the internet (with over 100m subscribers and up to 300m views on his videos), so I think Nouns featuring on his show would bring awareness to Nouns, NFTs, DAOs and Ethereum to millions. In doing so, it will allow people to see the great creative initiatives that Nouns are working on and have funded (e.g.[73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73))  as well as charities it has supported (e.g. [104](https://nouns.wtf/vote/104) ,[42](https://nouns.wtf/vote/42) ). On top of this I would hope it will showcase the ability of a decentralised network of people to raise funds and successfully deploy those funds in innovative ways that leverages its community to make big things happen!

Mr. Beast already has a good awareness of crypto and he has a history of giving to charity at a large scale too so hopefully he will be able to bring awareness to all of this in a thoughtful, considered, and fun way.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## **A $250k REWARD … THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY!?**
I can imagine some Nouners balking at the $250k prize being paid to whoever can convince Mr. Beast to take on this challenge, which is understandable.

My goal is to create value for the DAO and while one could argue that people will take on this challenge for a smaller amount – we just don’t know if it would be _as_ effective and ultimately it will always be a guess as to what the _right_ figure is.

The goal is to mobilise 99.9% of the internet and get them interested in making this happen through the incentive of a big reward. And while no one can be certain of the exact figure that would be most effective, what I _do_ know is that $250k has a high chance of success. It will advertise itself by getting people talking about it and it will massively increase the chances of the challenge being accepted. I believe we would rather potentially pay more to increase the chances of success.

While it is a lot of money, I think it presents extremely good value. Price is what you pay and value is what you get. If no one can make it happen, nothing gets paid out and the price is zero. But if someone does make it happen, a $750k price to have the Nouns featured on the most watched show on the internet will provide great value.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## **WHAT DO I GET FROM THIS?**
Nothing
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Terms and Conditions**
*   Transfer will be made to the prize winner after the video has aired on YouTube.
*   Mr. Beast cannot refer himself as the person to win the prize.
*   If Mr. Beast decides to do the show but does not (or can not) identify the person or message that convinced him to take it on - the $250k will be put into a prop house round where $50k will be awarded to 5 charities as voted on by Nouners.
*   The $500k (340 Eth) will be transferred from the multisig to Mr. Beast upon written agreement between the parties.
*   For the interest of transparency and to avoid conflicts of interest: I am not Mr. Beast nor do I have any affiliation with him in any way. If (somehow) it is me or this proposal that convinces him to do the challenge or to do it for charity, I will pledge the prize fund to charity and no Nounder will be eligible to win this prize.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

**Funds**
If the proposal passes, Eth to the equivalent of $750k will be converted to USDC to fund the challenge and any excess will be returned to the treasury. 

The funds will remain in the multisig until either the challenge is accepted or converted back to Eth and returned to the treasury after 9 months if the challenge is not accepted.

The funds will be held in a 2 / 3 Multisig with the signatures being:

169,Nouns DAO V2.1 Minor Fix,"# Nouns DAO V2.1 Minor Fix

## Summary

This proposal updates the Nouns DAO logic contract to a new version, with a single minor improvement:

**Vote with Gas Refund**: change refund destination such that multisig voter that pays for gas get refunded, rather than sending the refund to the multisig contract. 

Technically, this change involves refunding `tx.origin` instead of `msg.sender`.

Exact changes can be seen here: https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/604

Because this change is very minor, we're not going through an official audit process. This change has been reviewed thoroughly by technical DAO members (solimander & vapeape).

## Background
The Nouns Name Service (NNS) received 2 ETH in Prop House – Round 2 (April 2022) as trial funding to prove out the concept and build our reputation as trustworthy builders in the ecosystem.
 
After 4 months of work we delivered the first version of the NNS (nns.xyz) and in the first month post-launch, we have already created a powerful ecosystem of partners which allowed the NNS to be natively resolved across the Nouns ecosystem.

## Summary
This proposal will allow the NNS to build the infrastructure required to start phase 2 of our strategy: Expansion.

In particular, these are the main goals of this phase, which will be completed over a 5 months period:

* Integrate the NNS into new DAOs, apps and marketplaces outside the Nouniverse.
* Integration of an additional .nouns TLD that will help overcome .⌐◨-◨ copy-paste problems on external apps making its applications more flexible and effective.
* Create a DAO powered by Nouns Builder to empower the NNS Squad, our community of people who got their .⌐◨-◨, with an experimental treasury to reward members and finance new initiatives.
* Build new utility tools around the NNS. The first in the pipeline is a nounish NNS version of EtherScan. 
* Launch the Nounish Club project to push proliferation in and outside the Nouniverse through a new experiment of community reward and participation.
* Create a full documentation for end-users and developers expanding the ways in which they can integrate the NNS in their projects.
* Start the first experiments and collaborations for Phase 3.

**Requesting** funding of 195 ETH to execute our Expansion Phase.

Funds will be immediately converted in USDC to avoid volatility exposure of any kind.

## How the NNS started
The idea of the NNS originated from a question:
 
*“Is there a way to transform a meme icon into a fully functional domain, where its utility grows proportionally to the meme adoption?”*
 
During the first months of work, this idea evolved from its very first draft on Prop House, letting the NNS become a possible solution to several interesting scenarios:
 
* In an ecosystem based on CC0 like the Nouniverse, with a lot of new communities and sub-DAOs, the .⌐◨-◨ could become a universal tool for companies and creators to interact with the entire ecosystem at once.
***How so?***
The power of a CC0 ecosystem is the proliferation of a main idea in many sub-projects and communities. In the Nouniverse, that idea is represented by the ⌐◨-◨ meme. The noggles appear in every nounish community, but at the same time they are part of different NFTs and collections. At the moment, there isn’t a token that can unify the Nouns ecosystem at an infrastructural level. The .⌐◨-◨ can fill this gap, allowing companies and creators to reach the whole ecosystem by simply integrating the NNS into their token-gated experiences and initiatives.

* The more the NNS is integrated on new apps and marketplaces across the world, the more the .⌐◨-◨  will help spread the nounish culture at an exponential level.
***How so?***
The NNS serves as an on-chain identity badge for all the people who share the nounish culture. Having your .⌐◨-◨  attached to your web3 identity makes it clear that you belong to the “nounish internet society”. The more the NNS will expand, the more the Nouns proliferation will reach places that wouldn’t even have been considered before.

* In a market dominated by 2 titan projects and few TLDs, the NNS could become the first experiment of a collaborative naming system on ETH. This would allow other communities to join the NNS and create their own TLD on top of the NNS, making the whole protocol stronger and more widely adopted, and offering the new communities the advantage of having their TLD natively resolved across the NNS network from day 1. 
***How so?***
Once the Nouns Name Service is globally recognised by important apps in the space, it could open its network to other communities as well. This way, communities will not only get their customized TLD (that’s nothing new), but this will be able to be natively resolved everywhere from the very beginning. This will literally onboard in the Nouniverse and in Nouns DAO whole communities made by end-users and talented builders, constantly bringing new ideas and improving engagement thanks to a proven system of funding based on Prop House, Small Grants and all the other nounish DAOs.

**In a nutshell,** for a community joining the NNS would mean not only having a naming infrastructure, but also being able to build and nurture important relationships in the Nouniverse that will push new ideas and collaborations with the entire ecosystem.

These applications, which at the moment represent our focus, will offer Nouns and the Nouniverse an important value in terms of proliferation, new users in existing nounish platforms and the attraction of new builders.

And we are confident this is just the beginning of many other applications for the NNS.

## Roadmap (The 3 Phases)
Building this kind of Naming System is a big task. Which is why we split our development in 3 Phases. After the first one is completed, the NNS will be able to move to the next one, and so on.

### PHASE 1: Core Ecosystem and Community
The power of any protocol lies in its network.
That’s why our top priority since launch has always been to build a strong core ecosystem from which we can expand.

While new naming systems often rely on external plugins to resolve their names, the NNS aims to create a network where every NNS name is natively resolved without any additional action by the users.
 
At the time of writing, the NNS has been supported by all the major nounish projects, officially connecting the Nouniverse. 

[![Nouns-Name-Service-NNS-projects.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/SNcXyNvt/Nouns-Name-Service-NNS-projects.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/RNVCd99c)
 
**ENS reservation period and stats:** 

During the first 60 days after launch NNS names could only be claimed by their correspondent .eth.
 
While this impacted the NNS growth in the very short term, it also allowed the early adopters to have full control of their identities, thus focusing more on identity than speculation.

The ENS reservation ended on 19 October 2022 with the following results:

* 355 names claimed
* 252 unique owners
 
As you’re reading this, after 4 months of development and 2 months of Reservation Period, Phase 1 is officially completed.

At this time, 2 weeks after the end of the Reservation Period, a total of 526 .⌐◨-◨  names have been registered from 311 unique owners.

[![nns-launch-artwork.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/KvH4WgjG/nns-launch-artwork.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/mt7bzk7J)

### PHASE 2: Expansion and Nounish Club

Phase 2 will start the real proliferation of the NNS.

As mentioned in the TL;DR, the Expansion phase will have several goals, starting from the integration of the NNS in new DAOs, apps and marketplaces outside the Nouns ecosystem, also solving the .⌐◨-◨ current copy-paste issue. 

Part of the Expansion will also be the building of an NNS Scan, which you can picture like an NNS version of EtherScan. We will also create a new and more complete website, where end-users and developers will be able to access a full documentation so that they can find new ways to integrate the NNS in their projects. 

The NNS Squad will also have access to an experimental Treasury which will be used to reward active members and finance new missions.

Finally, and what we believe is the most exciting part of this Phase, we will launch the Nounish Club project to push proliferation through an experimental form of community reward and participation. 

At the end of these developments, we will start the first experiments and collaborations for Phase 3. 

### The Nounish Club 

The Nounish Club is an experiment made to reward nouners, nounish projects and communities outside the Nouniverse through new forms of community participation.
 
The idea is to allocate to this initiative all the numbers from 0 to 9999.⌐◨-◨, making them a new coveted asset to stimulate NNS proliferation and inspire new community ideas.

However, these numbers won't be available to be bought from the NNS.

They will only be earnable by taking active part in .⌐◨-◨ proliferation and in special initiatives, and they will be entirely distributed for free through what we like to call a “Proof of Proliferation” process. 

The Nounish Club will be an exclusive group inside the NNS, completely in the hands of the Nouniverse.
 
Every nounish project will be able to add a special benefit to the club, such as discounts, NFTs, voting power, early accesses and more. They will also be able to ask the NNS to get a specific allocation of numbers to be shared among their communities or to be used as assets to keep in their treasury.
 
The more benefits will be added, the more the access to the Nounish Club will be valued.

Here are some key points of how this would work:

* The NNS will allocate an initial amount of numbers to the NNS Squad DAO created through Nouns Builder. This will add an additional asset to the treasury that will be managed according to DAO voting.
* For the first 6 months, the numbers from 0 to 669 will be reserved for Nouners. Every existing nouner, as well as new ones, can request their specific numbers offering their help to proliferate the Nouns Name Service or to add benefits to make the Nounish Club more valuable. 
* Specific numbers would be used to invite new strategic users into the Nouns ecosystem.
* Nounish DAOs and projects would be able to request a certain allocation of numbers for proliferation initiatives. This will make the distribution of the Nounish Club more and more decentralized.
* If the experimental allocation to the NNS Squad DAO is successful, the NNS will gradually allocate a bigger amount of numbers to the DAO over time. 

The Nounish Club benefits will be grouped on a url like nounishclub.wtf and new proposals about ideas, benefits and allocations can be managed through the NNS Squad DAO and discussed on the NNS Discord.

The Nounish Club will also use Prophouse as another important tool to generate and reward new ideas.

#### Why the Nounish Club?

We are exploring what the NNS can become through a continuous loop of never-tried before experiments and feedback. The Nounish Club is one of them.

The reason we are excited about the Nounish Club is that we believe it can be an interesting experiment which, if successful, will be able to create a massive value for every community in the Nouns ecosystem.

This value can be seen as:

* **Building value:** It will be a further incentive for nounish communities to build cool things for the NNS and the Nounish Club.
* **Proliferation value:** It will generate a further proliferation of the .⌐◨-◨  and can be used to onboard strategic users into the Nouns ecosystem.
* **Economic value:** The more the NNS and the Nounish Club will grow, the more every name of the Club will be valuable (incentivizing more building around it).

[![NNSproposal-artwork3.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/90rG85XH/NNSproposal-artwork3.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/hQRzvY72)

### PHASE 3: Protocol

Once the NNS is supported by the major platforms in the space and successfully completes all the other tasks, it will be ready to open the protocol to other communities.
 
This upgrade will allow other great projects to build their TLD on top of the Nouns Name Service.
 
This will strengthen the relationship between the Nouniverse and worldwide communities working together for the proliferation of the Nouns Name Service.
 
Dwelling on the developments of Phase 3 is not the focus of this proposal, which aims to focus on the Expansion and Phase 2. However, our ultimate mission is making Nouns the center of a naming revolution that will attract not only end users, but also companies and other big projects.
 
Some aspects of Phase 3 are still being brainstormed and we can’t wait to share more details with the community when they’ll be ready.

## FUNDS

### Personal context for full transparency from Dom (@dotnouns)

Besides the 2 ETH received from Prop House in April, all the NNS development was bootstrapped.

As a founder and a true believer in the NNS, since the end of May I decided to commit 90% of my time on the project, gradually reducing the personal clients I was following in my day job.
 
If this can seem a hazard to many, burning the bridges that could act as a way out allowed the project to be laser focused on execution and allowed the NNS to become what it is today.
 
The goal of this proposal is helping the NNS to build a starting fund that will push the development and the proliferation with the same laser focus that has characterized Phase 1.

### The request in a nutshell

We are requesting 195 ETH to scale the NNS, fully complete Phase 2 and begin experiments for Phase 3 as well.

Funds will be immediately converted in USDC to avoid volatility of any kind.

### How the funds will be used

The funding from this proposal will serve to develop the following areas, which will be crucial for the long-term success:
 
·  	**Expand the team** and hire top professionals for specific tasks or projects. In particular, main focus will be given to external integrations and community building.
·  	**Design a website** that will offer more support to end users and developers. This will include an extensive tech documentation and FAQ section.
·  	**Create a DAO for the NNS Squad through Nouns Builder.** The DAO treasury will be used to coordinate proliferation actions among members and to manage the allocation of numbers for the Nounish Club.
·  	**Create an NNS House on Prop House** focused on building new products for the NNS ecosystem, the Nounish Club and developing new integrations with important partners.
·  	**Push proliferation** in and outside the Nouns ecosystem through the Nounish Club.
·  	**Add a new .nouns TLD** that will help overcome .⌐◨-◨ copy-paste problems on external apps, thus making its applications more flexible and effective. 

### Thoughts about the .⌐◨-◨  copy-paste “issue”

One frequent objection about the .⌐◨-◨  is that noggles are not easy to type on the keyboard. This is indisputably true.

The .⌐◨-◨  is first of all an identity badge of the Nouniverse. That’s why it’s natively resolved on all the nounish platforms without any effort or action by the user.

Even if every tool built around the NNS would make writing the .⌐◨-◨ easy as a click, to expand the applications of the Nouns Name Service we are also exploring the creation of a .nouns TLD.
This domain would ease the integration of the NNS in several apps (especially wallets) and would unlock interesting additional applications.

In the future, NNS users would be able to connect all their NNS names to this core extension and from their dashboard they could decide how they want to appear in their favorite communities.

This development is still in brainstorming mode, but we wanted to share it to give some context about our initial focus and what we’re going to work on next.

### Milestones and funding release

In an effort to show our commitment and laser focus in the NNS mission, we decided to divide the funding allocation in 2 tranches.

The first 97.5 ETH will be unlocked upfront and will cover the first 3 months.
In particular, during this period we will: 

* Launch and proliferate the Nounish Club project and its DAO
* Release the new website with a full documentation
* Complete the first new integrations with projects outside the Nouns ecosystem
* Start the first experiments with the .nouns extension. (If everything works smoothly we will be able to release it during the first 3 months, otherwise it will be launched in month 4.)

The list only refers to the goals highlighted in this proposal and doesn't include actions that will be part of the ordinary proliferation strategy of the NNS, such as community initiatives, viral actions and collabs with other projects in and outside the Nouns ecosystem.

At the end of the first 3 months, these milestones will be checked and verified by nouns community members Toady Hawk and Benbodhi.

If this first Milestone Check is successful, the second and last part of the funding will be released.

### Multisig Wallet

Funds will be managed through a Gnosis multisig wallet (2/3) with the following trusted signers:

* [Dotnouns](https://twitter.com/dotnouns) (NNS)
* [Toady Hawk](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/toadyhawk.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8) (Proposal Sponsor and Milestones Checker)
* [Benbodhi](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/benbodhi.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8) (Milestone Checker)

## Conclusion

This is what the Nouns Name Service is right now, and what it could become.

We realize it’s an ambitious vision, and that there might be challenges and many things we didn’t predict, as for every venture in unexplored waters. 

However, ever since the beginning, we’ve tried to earn the community’s trust. We are now fully committing ourselves to something that could be extremely beneficial for the Nouns ecosystem in the long term.

**If you believe in this project, we ask you to consider supporting this proposal, so that we can together build the future of the Nouns Name Service!**

171,DCS Pod,"# DCS Pod

## tl;dr ##
DCS is a pod that focuses on bridging the gap between existing off-chain funding options and larger on-chain props. Focused primarily on the sectors of software, arts and IRL with a funding range between 8-25Ξ, our goal is to help builders with a track record scale up within the Nouns ecosystem.

## Overview ##

There currently exists a large gap within the current Nouns funding landscape that creates challenges for Nounish builders in the ecosystem. 

On the lower end of the spectrum, there are many options for builders to seek funding for <10Ξ, between NSFW, Prop House, and a number of subDAO efforts (Gnars, SharkDAO, Lil Nouns, etc). On the higher end, there is virtually no limit as we have seen on-chain props go to $1M and beyond.

However, in between these two points there is a gap that continues to grow as we see NSFW, Prop House, and subDAOs prefering to run more experiments with smaller amounts, all the while prominent Nouners are increasingly calling for the DAO to scale upward and not consider on-chain props lower than 20Ξ.

This places builders in a tough spot where they must figure out how to take their concept from point A to point B to achieve escape velocity. This issue is further exacerbated by the closure of the official Nouns Discord server, which will make it harder for the DAO to reach consensus on on-chain props as a governing body.

DCS will focus on working with these builders who have ""graduated"" from one of the off-chain funding programs and provide them with bridge funding and guidance as they work towards the goal of passing a larger scale on-chain prop with the broader DAO base.

Said a different way, we help builders **Do Cool Sh*t**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/pMkWTM2.png)

## Pod Details ##

DCS pod members will leverage their Nounish network and experience to guide and work with builders to ensure their further success in the DAO. DCS will act as a working group to ensure our funded builders are provided more than just capital but an active group to collaborate with and build alongside.

**The pod plays a key role in four ways:**

- Creates a stepping stone for off-chain ""graduates"" on their journey to larger on-chain props, both in terms of financial support and guidance in refining their project
- Provides accountability and additional data points for the broader DAO to consider when the resulting props go on-chain
- Emphasizes a transparent decision making framework that is data-driven and scalable
- Actively works with builders to ensure their further success in the DAO by being a source of active support and guidance helping them move through the roadblocks and challenges they face

**What areas will the pod focus on?**

DCS will focus on key areas where we feel we can provide the most value and help ideas scale quickly. Given the subject matter expertise and experience of pod members, the following areas are our initial focus: 

- **Software** - dApps, smart contracts, mobile apps, gaming
- **Arts & Content** - artists, musicians, video and content creators
- **IRL** - local/regional activations, events, and other on-the-ground efforts


**How will the group operate?**

- Props (sourced from off-chain funding programs) will be be submitted to the pod online
- Prop will be discussed on weekly DCS calls
- Prop will be voted on in the DCS Discord

We will work with the operators of the various off-chain funding program to raise visibility for DCS as a ""next step"" for graduates. We will use Prop House and/or [AddressBoard](https://www.addressform.io/) to receive formal funding requests, so we can ensure proper data collection throughout the process for the DAO.

The pod will convene once a week on an open call to discuss what has been submitted since the last meeting and to discuss additional pipeline developments. These calls will be available to the community. This will foster discussion about props, help engage with builders and elevate the quality of props that get funded. Emphasis will be placed on data-driven processes to ensure greater builder accountability and proper measurement of ROI back to the DAO.

After discussion, pod members will decide which props will be funded by voting on a dedicated Discord channel (or via Prop House platform).

Pod members are required to attend weekly meetings and actively give feedback on props. Pod members can be removed and replaced based on participation (which will be decided by the remaining members of the pod). Pod members will be rotated every 3-6 months in order to spread knowledge, boost decentralization and to ensure the pod is not overly reliant on any single member. A maximum of 2 pod members will be substituted at a time, not to create disruption in the work flow. One pod member will be elected secretary by the pod, and this person will take care of administrative tasks including providing a summary of the meeting in writing, which will be available to the public through the DCS discord.

The committee’s gnosis safe will require 3 of 5 members to sign.

Budget: 126Ξ
Breakdown:
* Props: 75Ξ
* Admin: 51Ξ
    * Target prop funding: ranging from ~9x8Ξ - 3x25Ξ projects
    * 5 pod members
        * Core member: 3Ξ per month
        * Secretary: add'l 2Ξ per month

For context, this is 0,4% of our treasury. We are aiming to propose a low-risk/high-reward pod.

If at the end of the 3-month period not enough good props were found and funded, the funds will be returned to the Nouns DAO treasury. If the props funded were to be successful, leading to cool apps/tools/community building/engagement, we would ask for the continuation of the work through extended funding (granted by a new on-chain prop).

172,Fund Trustless USDC Payments Contract,"# Fund Trustless USDC Payments Contract

## Summary

In order to pay builders directly with USDC, we have deployed a contract (`TokenBuyer`) which swaps ETH for USDC on behalf of the DAO.

We propose to fund `TokenBuyer` with 625 ETH in order to acquire a USDC buffer of $500K (there's a baked in volatility buffer; any extra ETH will be used for later proposals or can come back to the treasury).

Future proposals created from nouns.wtf will automatically ""top off"" TokenBuyer with additional ETH, minimizing the need for additional funding proposals.

## Motivation

Many proposals have costs in USD (or other fiat currencies) and would prefer to request USDC for the DAO instead of ETH.

It is not trivial to swap ETH to USDC at proposal execution time without being subjected to sandwich attacks and getting bad swap rates.

## Solution

The tech pod developed [TokenBuyer](https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer) - a suite of smart contracts that allow permissionless swapping of tokens.

TokenBuyer will allow proposals to request payment amount in USDC.

The swapping of ETH to USDC happens asynchronously, meaning:
If the DAO doesn't have enough USDC on hand, it will register a debt for the remaining amount. As soon as the rest of the USDC is available, it is sent to the recipient's wallet, no user intervention needed. We expect this to take a few days at most, depending on the total amount.

TokenBuyer allows anyone to swap USDC for the ETH it holds. It uses Chainlink's ETH/USD price feed to set the price.

Whenever a proposal requests USDC from the DAO, it will also include a transaction to top up TokenBuyer with additional ETH, proportional to the USDC amount requested.

(*This ""automatic top-off"" is part of nouns.wtf; other governance clients can choose whether they implement this behavior*)

### Example:
* Builder A creates a proposal that requests 100,000 USDC
* 2 actions will be added to the proposal:
    1. Send 100K USDC from the TokenBuyer to Builder A
    2. Send $150K worth of ETH to TokenBuyer to swap for USDC
       * The extra $50K (50% buffer) is added in case ETH price goes down
       * If TokenBuyer already holds ETH, then it will be sent less ETH accordingly
* When the proposal executes:
    1. 100K USDC it sent to Builder A
        * If TokenBuyer has less than 100K USDC on hand, a debt will be registered towards Builder A
    3. TokenBuyer will swap ETH for 100K USDC
    4. Any remaining USDC debt to Builder A is paid as soon as it is swapped

### UI preview

This is a preview of a new proposal creation flow for nouns.wtf developed by Brian.
It will go live once it's possible to request USDC.

![proposal_ui_1](https://i.imgur.com/cOqFO3V.png)
![proposal_ui_2](https://i.imgur.com/vZNqCJ7.png)

### Parameters

* `baselinePaymentTokenAmount`: amount of USDC to hold ""on hand"". Currently set to $500,000.
* `botDiscountBPs`: a price discount to incentivize anyone (probably bots) to swap USDC for ETH. Currently set to 10 bps (0.1%).

### Admin access
* The tech pod & the DAO have an ""operator"" privilege with permissions to:
    * Modify `baselinePaymentTokenAmount`, allowed range is: 0 - $1M
    * Modify `botDiscountBPs`, allowed range is: 0-150 (0-1.5%)
    * Pause TokenBuyer swaps
    * Withdraw ETH from TokenBuyer and send it to the DAO
    * Change the operator
* Only the DAO has the ability to:
    * Send USDC
    * Change the allowed ranges for `baselinePaymentTokenAmount` and `botDiscountBPs`

### Arbitrage bot
* A reference bot has been developed and [open-sourced](https://github.com/solimander/eth-buyer-arbitrage-bot) by solimander. We encourage anyone to run their own bot or improve on the code
* The tech pod will be running the reference bot at the beginning to bootstrap the system
* Anyone can perform swaps against TokenBuyer. If we see low activity, we will increase the `botDiscountBPs` parameters to increase the incentive (e.g. if gas prices become high).

## Auditing and Testing

* The smart contracts were audited by yAcademy. [Audit report](https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer/blob/166ec30ecd5dada8e17b55317ce3823d4c36b35f/audit/yAcademy_NounsDAO_TokenBuyer_review.pdf)
    * No ""critical"" issues were found
    * 1 ""high"" and 1 ""medium"" issues were found. The ""high"" issue was fixed, and the ""medium"" issue was acknowledged as not being an issue for us.
* Prior to this proposal a few rounds of funding and spending using Token Buyer were done on mainnet


## Funding
* Assuming `baselinePaymentTokenAmount` is set to $500K, we would want to fund TokenBuyer with enough ETH to swap for $500K. We suggested adding an extra 50% to account for price changes. At current ETH prices this 750,000 / 1200 = 625 ETH
* The initial ETH amount will be sent to the tech pod multisig
* The tech pod will deploy it into TokenBuyer in chunks while monitoring that it performs correctly

# Description

### Why Sailing?
I ([fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)) have been sailing for 11 years and recently combined my passion for sailing and love of Nouns by organizing a regatta through Seoul (funded by [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102)). Sailing is one of the most prestigious sports and often gets attention of the media, guests, and residents. It's enjoyable to participate in, to watch live, and creates beautiful images and video to share.


### Nouns in the New York Harbor
NFT.NYC is only four months away. Most likely NFT and web3 projects are going to run the same promotions with posters and billboards. *Why not make something different?*

Following the success of [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102), I would like to organize a sailing event on April 9th in New York with help of Manhattan Yacht Club. The NFT.NYC sailing event is going to be order of magnitute larger to match the gravity of the legendary New York.


I will put together a fleet of seven J/24 sailboats and one bigger sailboat in New York bay with Nounish sails. We are going to invite Nounish people and sail together from New Jersey to Manhattan, Brooklyn Bridge, and the Statue of Liberty.

We'll be using J/24 sailboats for this event because it is the world's most popular one-design keelboat. It is a classic Porsche of sailing and respected by all sailors. It is easy to sail and looks beautiful when you get up the Nounish spinnakers.


### Interactive Community Building
The plan is to make teams of 3 experienced sailors and 3-4 guests for each boat. The guests will be able to actively participate by steering boats and trimming sails. We are going to use one bigger boat to accomodate all guests and swap guests on boats near the Statue Of Liberty so all the guests can get full experience. 100 people will be invited, with priority to for the Nouns community. 20 invitations will be sent to special NFT.NYC attendees (media, artists, etc.) 

It is going to be unforgettable experience. Later, we can gather together at Manhattan Yacht Club's clubhouse and share a few beers.

Let's enjoy early spring sailing in NYC together and use this unique opportunity as a team building and proliferating event. A lot of New Yorkers and visitors are going to see Nouns logos during NFT.NYC and posted on social networks.

### Documentation
All events/locations before and during the event will be documented and all media will be regularly shared with the [nounish ⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/nounish) team and posted on social networks.

# Details

### Event map

### Nouns branded sail designs
![](https://i.imgur.com/S7SfqsE.jpg)

Based on sail inventory availabe at Manhattan Yacht Club, it would be best to buy both mainsail and spinnaker sails. The available at manhattan yacht club sails have mount gay rum logos and wouldn't look good during our photo ops.

Discussions on sail designs and upcomming events will be posted on twitter and nounish discord.

After NFT.NYC, the sails will be shipped and stored in my yacht club, in korea for possible future Nounish events.

There are four different design options availbe
1) same color fabric, red noggles
2) same color fabric, different color noggles
3) different color fabrick, red noggles
4) different color fabric, different color noggles

IMO most of the beautiful thing about nouns community is collective hacking, designing, and thinking. I would like to get feedback from community to find best sail designs.

# Budget
### Nouns NFT.NYC sailing photo op & team building
We going to invite as many people as possible, starting with Nounish folks. The event would be a best way to proliferate Nouns and organize a team building event for Nounish people.
- **$24,000** Chartering fees for 7+ boats at Manhattan Yacht Club
    - I received quote of $3,800 per boat for a general public
    - The price might go down after I send an official request from my yacht club
- **$35,000** Nouns sails inventory for 7+ boats
    - (branded spinnakers and mainsails)
    - I wil keep all the sails safe for future possible events. For example, NFT.NYC sailing event in 2024!
- **$10,000** Small travel grants for sailing teams comming from Seattle, San Francisco, Texas, Michigan, Maryland.
    - We need experienced crew to operate sailboats.
    - The plan is to make teams of 3 pro sailors and 3-4 guests per one boat
- **$15,000** Safety and media motor boats etc
    - It is very important to have a couple motor boats available for media or in the case of emergency
- **$5,000** The big boat is going to accomodate more guests. Later, on the way back from the Statue Of Liberty, we aregoing to swap guests and give more people chance to experience J/24 sailing.
    - NFT.NYC is a big event and we might want to invite a lot of interesting people to the Nouns sailing event
    - Also, some parts of New York bay is no fly zone for drones so it would be best to put a few photographers on a bigger boat
- **$15,000** photo/video team
- **$5,000** Nouns branded t-shirts and caps to look like a true team (120 pcs)
- **$5,000** BBQ, beers, and rum for after party at Manhattan Yacht Club
- **$21,000** expenses for operations team including me; $7k per person (I will need at least two reliable people with sailing experience with me to organize 7+ sailboats, photo ops, coordinate everyone etc; getting ready venue and boats 2 days before the event; 2 days cleaning boats and packing everything after the event)
- **$15,000** budget for unexpected expenses and price offset (we can use some money to make invitations, rent more sailboats, buy more sails, stickers for boats, add more safety measures, shipping or storage for sails after the event etc)
- **$10,000** I would like to request a small compensation for my efforts to plan the event for next 3 months.

**Total: $160,000 or ~134 ETH (1 ETH = $1,200)**

We are asking for $160,000. It is a lot of money but it is worth every dollar if you look at everything we are going to accomplish.

174,Proposal tracking by maty,"# Proposal tracking by maty

**TLDR**: Fund maty to continue tracking all funded [proposals](http://www.proposal.wtf) (46 ETH saved) and writing [newsletters](https://nouns.substack.com/) (over 16k views) for 5.5 ETH/month.

## About me
Active in nouns every day for a year, founding Nouncil and Esports Pod member, Discord mod (rip), NSFW team member... but most of my work has been centered around a weekly newsletter and proposal tracking dashboards I have created in Notion.

## Tracking proposals
**Problem:**  It's hard to follow individual projects after they get funded, the information is scattered. Accountability is important.

**Solution:** 
- I'm following up with builders of all funded projects, providing a way for builders to share all the awesome work they've done
- Saving the data to Notion [proposal.wtf](http://www.proposal.wtf) - 5 interconnected dashboards with all the important info, allows anyone to quickly and easily search for any project, filter and sort them based on various properties or see all projects by a particular builder.

Thanks to these follow-ups, I have contributed to **46 ETH being returned to the DAO** (from 2 proposals with leftover funds).

**Future focus:** 
- Getting cleaner-looking dashboards up on nouns.center (in collaboration with cdt, you can already find the Communities list we made [here](https://nouns.center/groups))
- Working with the Agora team to display relevant information in Agora profiles


![](https://i.imgur.com/1sdJQWz.gif)




## Newsletter 
**Problem:** Information overload, hundreds of funded projects + even more seeking funding. With the dissolution of the official Discord server, this only got worse.
**Solution:** 
- Weekly [newsletter](https://nouns.substack.com/) highlighting the biggest things happening around nouns, showcasing new proposed projects, new on-chain proposals, art, and more. Serves as an information distribution mechanism and as a historical snapshot of the DAO. [*Example*](https://nouns.substack.com/p/raising-from-the-ashes).
- Special posts for Prop House rounds with TLDRs of all proposals (and other functions when needed) everything in one place, easy to read. [*Example*.](https://nouns.substack.com/p/prop-house-special-nouns-launchpad-9da)
    - this helps us more effectively deploy capital via Prop House
- Newsletter data:
    - over 50 posts already (6 a month on average), with **over 16,000 reads** in total!
    - latest posts get around 350-400 readers
    - subscriber count is in a steady uptrend from the start, currently at 430

**Future focus:**
- highlighting the newly emerging communities
- special posts with big proposal updates (highlights of changes from the dashboards)

## Funding
Previously my work has been funded via NSFW (monthly, based on the amount of work, 4.5-5.5 ETH), but since now I am an active member of NSFW, I am seeking funding via on-chain proposal.
I am asking for **5.5 ETH a month** for 7 months:
- 1 month retro for October (7 newsletter posts, maintaining the dashboard and adding a new one - Communities/Groups)
- 6 months going forward, paid via Sablier stream (until the end of April)

175,PropBox: A Nouns Proposal Incubator,"# PropBox: A Nouns Proposal Incubator

## TL;DR

Using lessons from a Nouncil trial program, we will set up a robust incubator that will help the best builders in the ecosystem smoothly navigate the Nouns DAO proposal process.  

**Our goal is to leverage the breadth and depth of skillsets within UglyDAO to help nounish builders communicate well and find pathways to funding, so that they can keep doing what they do best:** 

**BUILDING.**

# The Challenges



1. **The Nouns DAO Proposal Process Can be Daunting to New Builders.**
    
    Writing a proposal is difficult. Conveying a good idea in a way that voters can understand and relate to is even more difficult.  With the increased number of proposals and ideas coming in weekly, it’s more important than ever to effectively communicate one's idea and value proposition.  For some builders, proposal writing may not be a core strength. So their proposals may fail on-chain, even if the core concept is valuable.
    
2. **Effective Communication with DAO Voters is Difficult**
    
    One of the most difficult challenges for builders in the Nouns ecosystem has always been figuring out how to have open dialog with voting Nouners and Delegates. These challenges will only increase as the DAO grows. Now, with the Official Nouns Discord closed, this is an even more pressing issue. 
    
3. **Constructive and Honest Feedback is Rare**
    
    Very few people within Nouns are giving truly honest and constructive criticism to proposals that need work. Discourse and Nouncil feedback sometimes can be “soft”, as people may not want to publicly discuss the potential pitfalls of a fellow community member’s idea or hurt their feelings.  We see this occurring more frequently with on-chain proposals, and it doesn’t help anyone in the long run.

# Our Solutions

**PropBox will aim to solve the above pain points in the following ways:**

1. Ugly Dao has a talented roster of builders, many of whom have experience writing successful proposals for Prop House, NSFW and on-chain. We also have professionals with experience in the legal, marketing, education, and communications fields. With our combined training and experience, we can help builders create proposals that make an impact. Additionally, sometimes the most difficult part of seeking funding from Nouns is **knowing where to go.** We can help proposers understand if their idea is best suited to a Prop House round, an NSFW pitch, a discussion with the newly minted DCS Pod, or a full on-chain proposal. Finally, we believe that proposals should lean on multimedia content to achieve maximum impact in an attention-scarce environment. We want to help builders integrate engaging videos and visuals into their proposals.

2. We know the Nouns community like the back of our Ugly hand, and can help new builders navigate the difficult task of amplifying the message of their proposal. From appearances on The Noun Square, discussions in Nouncil or other Nounish discords, as well as conversations on Twitter, Discourse, House of Nouns and elsewhere, we know how to help builders with the most difficult part of getting funded for a proposal: **Communicating directly with the people who ultimately will vote yes or no.** 

3. The DAO needs more well-intentioned people who are not afraid to give would-be builders The Ugly Truth, and we are prepared to do so.


# The PropBox Value Prop

Our goal is to become the premier resource to help builders create great proposals and find pathways to funding in the Nouns ecosystem. We plan to find and incubate teams and projects from multiple sources, including:

- Current builders in the ecosystem who are looking for feedback and help navigating the proposal process.
- New builders who need extra help onboarding into Nouns, writing proposals, and making the right connections to be successful.
- “Uncut gems” from Prop House and Discourse to fund proof of concept projects and prepare the teams for potential larger on-chain proposals in the future. We aim to find builders with the highest potential and help them fulfill that potential. Ideas from this category should have at least 10x potential from the amount of initial funding.

# The Origin Story

This project began as an initiative by [Andrew ](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/andrewladdusaw.eth)[Laddusaw](https://twitter.com/AndrewLaddusaw), through [Nouncil](https://discord.gg/nouncil), following the [Combinator Round in Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round:-25-eth) back in July (aka “the before times.”) Andrew saw a lot of talented teams that submitted great proposals, but of course the round only had one winner for the 25ETH prize. 

He began contacting builders and building a system within Nouncil Discord to give these teams feedback to prepare them for an on-chain proposal, or to help them secure alternative funding sources. When they began reviewing proposals publicly as a group, other builders asked for help as well.

During this initial trial, the Incubator team gave feedback to 9 proposals. Through that process: One secured funding through NSFW. One pursued another Prop House to fund a proof of concept, won, and later joined Nouncil. One ended up abandoning the initial idea, but moved on to other projects during the incubation process, and has now been funded for multiple other projects within the DAO (shout out [ripe0x](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/ripe0x.eth).) Two other proposals ended up with on-chain votes, one narrowly being defeated and one securing funding for 40 ETH (Prop 144 for One Click Bots).

*Click to watch a 2 minute PropBox testimonial video from Andrei (BotFrens)*

We learned a lot through this experiment. We’re continuing to follow up with the builders as they hone their ideas, and expect to see even more fruit from these efforts in the coming months. We’re also continuing to improve our feedback process and we believe we’re ready for the next phase of growth.


# The Timeline

**This proposal will support the PropBox team for a 3 month period to do the following:**

- Actively locate builders in the ecosystem to help drive their ideas forward and guide them through the proposal process that is most appropriate to their ideas and building stage.
- Create an active Builder’s Guild in the PropBox Discord, where those who are creating tools and proposals can do so in the open, and together. This well help create consistent startup energy in the Nouns community.
- Review every Discourse, and various Discord community posts, making sure everyone submitting proposal ideas gets quality feedback and the best possible Nouns experience when they first arrive in the community. One of our greatest desires is that new, talented builders would not leave the community discouraged after getting negative feedback, simply because they didn’t understand the funding process or the culture of what it means to be a part of Nouns.
- Create a website to house a toolkit of templates, best practices, tips and tricks, and contact information giving builders a toolbox to maximize success.
- We will also spend the next three months exploring several ideas, which we will present to the community at the end of the proposal funding period:
    - *How to potentially make an incubator like this self-sustaining in the future.*
    - *A system to temperature check proposals and gather feedback from as many sources as possible, including from those with the most likelihood to swing vote outcomes.*
    - *How to create efficiencies in the proposal process, so that new community members can transition from their first interactions to building as effectively as possible within the DAO.*
    - *Exploring systems of trust-building to make sure that scammers are not able to abuse the treasury through gaming or fraud.*
    - *Decisions about what form this group should take in the future; how to incorporate new members, ideas, and processes to maintain the highest degree of quality feedback, help, and value to the DAO.*


All of the above is to serve the ultimate goals of PropBox: 

**To help builders write high quality proposals, and to make decision-making simpler and less time-consuming for DAO members.**

# The Budget

**75ETH** **Total**

- **60 ETH** - In our trial, we were able to achieve a great deal of success with people who were just volunteering their time. We know that with DAO funding, we will have much more capacity to onboard talented builders and incubate many more proposals. 
    - **20 ETH** per month as a payment to team members, to be paid retroactively based on work completed and builders helped. This work will include engaging builders at every stage of the proposal process, guiding them, and helping to write effective and media-rich proposals. These team rewards will be distributed via biweekly Coordinape rounds (Nouncil model.) All payment data will be publicly available to the DAO. 
    - Our team goal will be to engage with a minimum of 30 builders about their proposals over the course of a 3 month period. 
    
- **10 ETH** for a pool to fund some small projects, as an experiment in additional targeted flexible funding for the DAO: Taking small ideas that we encounter through the process of our work and helping those teams to execute small ideas or create MVPs of larger ones. 
- **5 ETH** of retro funding for what has been done to build this system already.

# The PropBox Team

We are a group of Nounish builders that have created and executed successful proposals at every funding level. We are consistently active in Discourse, offering constructive feedback and working privately with builders to help them formulate effective proposals and seek funding. We are passionate about great ideas, effective communication, and robust proposals that drive the nounish meme forward. ⌐◨-◨

# The Bottom Line

We believe the DAO needs to attract more awesome builders, and needs teams of diligent people finding good ideas and helping them to bloom into full-fledged, effective Nounish initatives. 

We are uniquely qualified to help these builders write awesome proposals, strategize ideal funding paths, and facilitate DAO communications, and we are asking for a mandate to do exactly that.

### **Introduction**

Hello **NounsDAO**,

I'm **Voadz**, one of the Nouncillors. Periodically, I've seen a tonne of contests hosted by our nounish communities such as [coloring book contests](https://nounsarchive.wtf/portfolio/nounsense-02) by Noun22 & Messhup, [memes contests](https://nounsarchive.wtf/portfolio/noadz-valentines-day) by Noadz, and is now mainly being held by the [Noun Square](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) team. We have seen full of delightful contest submissions with all sorts of genres from all across the world.

I took an initiative to build a website where we can display all of the entries from NounsDAO's contestants because I personally feel it is very important for the DAO to do so. Additionally, it provides access to all future possibilities. 

As time passes, I feel it needs to grow even more by including all of the Nouns projects from the community and not only the contestants. Our memes proliferations are all contained inside.

Why is it important to document and archive these things?

### **Summary**

* **Long-term Vision** ; 
    * To retain past and future historical key data of all talented builders & artists that contribute around Nouns ecosystem.

* **Objective** ; 
    * 1) To help **onboard newcomers** that are interested in Nouns so they can catch a **glimpse** of what the project is all about. Navigation will be improved through enhanced visual design to create a stronger first impression.
    * 2) **References that act as inspiration**. Drawing from references is beneficial because it provides our imaginations with tangible things to model after.
    * 3) To create potential opportunity for artists / builders to receive **commissions or collaborative works/projects** with others.

* **Strategy** ; 
    * 1) **Simplified TL;DR / streamlined landing page with upgraded visuals** consists of ; *to browse relevant areas & specific parameters* ;
            * simplified projects/contests brief
            * project owner/hosts
            * total funded/prizes
            * categories (*ex; art, community, tech, marketing, physical etc*)
            * links to discourse/full props/related infos/contests
            * social media (*ex; twitter, discord*)
            * tags / filters *(most recent, oldest, alphabetically)*
            * distinct project images with descriptions
            * status
            * contest winners
            * CC0 label together with proof of CC0 (*ex; toggle/submit forms etc*)
            * search bar with data points
            *( all are shown under **Details**)*

    * 2) **Coordinate with other existing platforms** already in place (ex. ***[nouns.center](https://nouns.center/), [proposal.wtf](https://maty-eth.notion.site/maty-eth/NounsDAO-Proposals-Overview-b8c76e6ac8e44515966ee032ea20f860), [nounish](https://twitter.com/nounish)***) by pooling resources & efforts for maximum efficiency and also to complement each other.
    * 3) **Contents sustainability** ; we will be using Notion for the database and will be publically viewable. Content submission form with formats will be available for community use. An additional idea is to work with Nouns AI team for data scraping by using certain hashtags/keywords *(to be discuss)*.
    * 4) **CC0 Contents & Icon** ; any artist can **enable or declare** their work to be CC0 by submitting forms that will be made available soon. It is freely usable by anyone for remixing and other creative purposes. A ""CC0"" icon will appear that contains additional proof of CC0.
    * 5) A **daily dose of nounish things** ; daily curated posting of one random nounish project to give more **visibility & brand consistency** for long term goals.
    * 6) Main whiteboard to organise works ; [Nouns Archive's FigJam](https://www.figma.com/file/g1etPE6nK6WtwK35i9C8gs/Nouns-Archive?node-id=0%3A1).

![](https://i.imgur.com/YtMFFYJ.jpg)

* **Measuring Success** ; 
    * 1) We are tracking using Google Analytics and will factor in a monthly report & insights of the website.
    * 2) As per *image* attached, it is an event count for 2 months. 
    * 3) Organic views and engagements will always be the baseline metrics, but currently, **85%** of the contents are exclusively focus on contest entries. We anticipate that the graph will eventually be higher once we have completed building an MVP jointly across all nounish projects.
![](https://i.imgur.com/C8Iu47E.png)


* **Deliverables** ; 
    * 1) Empower existing website, [nounsarchive.wtf](https://nounsarchive.wtf/) as per whole new concept interface attached above.
    * 2) **On-the-go** website with comprehensive materials, including numerous projects and submissions.
    * 3) As per said under ***Strategy***.
    * 4) Biweekly reports and updates on new developments on discourse & social media (*twitter & discord*). Planning to search for other new platform that is suitable to use.

* **What we have delivered** ; 
    * 1) [Nouns Archive Center Website](https://nounsarchive.wtf/) - Funded by [NSFW Team](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-archive-center/2413)

177,Nouns funding ZachXBT,"# Nouns funding ZachXBT

[@ZachXBT](https://twitter.com/zachxbt) is a public good serving the crypto ecosystem through tireless research exposing [countless scams](https://investigations.notion.site/). Recent events have highlighted the dire need and importance of such work. This prop proposes to fund 100 ETH to their donation address: zachxbt.eth (address can be verified from their twitter profile).

Donations have always been somewhat controversial within Nouns governance. [Prop 21](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) donating 169 ETH to Gitcoin grants was one of the most contentious votes in our early history. [Prop 108](https://nouns.wtf/vote/108) donating 500 ETH to Ethereum protocol development (via the Protocol Guild) was much more unanimous but still there was discomfort and discourse around whether the DAO was becoming ""a tax inefficient way for DAO members to make donations."" 

I agree that we shouldn't resort to becoming a complacent vehicle of passive philanthropy. We should instead aim to actively contribute and be a net producer of public goods ourselves such that our meme (brand) can fully capture the provenance value (claim on originality of) the public work and thus leverage the virtuous cycle to do more than what capital alone could have done. However, there should be exceptions to this rule if there is an urgent and common public cause that warrants highlighting. I would like to suggest that this is such a case. Crypto needs more validators like ZachXBT.

With donations we need to be extra wary of conflicts of interest or self-dealing. Unfortunately there is no way to prove this cryptographically, but I attest that I have no prior (or planned future) relationship with ZachXBT and that today was the first time I contacted them (via twitter) to ask for their permission to make this proposal.

![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/b/be6270ef4049c16180cde5177b5c21ac878d1b7b_2_690x431.png)

# Explorer Grants - Trial

**Core Issue:** A lot of talented builders have Nouns on their radar, but are not sure how to contribute. The only place we actively incentivize them with ideas and funding is Prop House mandated rounds, which are retroactive, leaving builders who lose the round uncompensated for their work. Otherwise, they must figure out problems themselves and then ask for money, a difficult process if someone has no connections to the ecosystem.

**Solution:** Create a program to actively recruit new talented builders and pro-actively fund them to explore the Nouns ecosystem.

### TL;DR
* 1 grant = 10 ETH for 2 months of exploration, goal for each builder is to have an on-chain prop by end of the period
* 5 builders (50 ETH total) in first trial run
* 3 members on operations team (mrtn, jihad, dot), lightly compensated; 2 more on multi-sig (yitong and krel)
* Transparency is key

### Eligibility
- Must NOT be actively or recently funded by Nouns, or clearly an existing participant in the Nouns ecosystem
- Must be new to the broader Nouns ecosystem
- Must be working / actively exploring _something_ directly related to NounsDAO while on grant, or it will be revoked
- Preference for people who can proactively create independently — particularly engineers, but also content creators, designers, writers, etc

### Operation Details
The entire process will be transparent via a public Discord and run by the 3-person team, who will be lightly compensated to do this work, ensuring accountability and commitment. Our initial proposal had no funding for the team, but we were recommended otherwise by Nouners.

**Public Application:**
* Explorer Grants will be publicized via Twitter, 1:1 outreach from the team and its network, Twitter Spaces with Nouns community organizations, Discords, etc
* Candidates will submit public applications, showing past work and motivations for exploring the Nouns ecosystem, as well as a couple problem spaces that interest them
  * These applications will also benefit the community at large who can recruit builders from this group
* Candidates will largely be assessed on talent, potential, and excitement about Nouns. Reasoning for accepted candidates will be made public. The 3-person team will decide on 4 final candidates to accept.
* 1 slot in the program will be allocated to a Nouns community vote

**Program:**
* 10 ETH for 2 months of part-time exploration for each builder
  * *Detail: Overpaying slightly is critical to attracting talent that may not otherwise come to us. We are targeting people who make more than $150,000 a year in their full-time job*
* Weekly check-in call with builders. Members of the Explorer Grants team will help them explore ideas, connect them to Nouners and builders, and lead workshops
* **End of Program Objective:** each builder submits an on-chain or Prop House prop for continued funding

### Team
* **mrtn, lead organizer:**
    * Previously a PM at Google and NBA Top Shot, he has now contributed to a variety of Nounish projects - Nouns Builder, AI Pod, Agora, as well as doing a 24 Hour Nounish live stream, and receiving a Governance Historian grant. At USC, he ran an organization that guided students towards entrepreneurship, whose members include several YC startups. He's a big believer in diversifying funding sources for Nouns builders, and experimenting with the patronage model. *Comp: 3 ETH / month*
* **jihad, community & product expert:**
    * Core contributor at Forefront, creating media and building infrastructure for tokenized communities. He is also a delegate and “Lil Nouncilor” at Lil Nouns DAO, a contributor to Public Nouns, one of the winners of the recent Nouns Agora delegate race, and is part of the team building [Adjectives](nouns.terminal.co), an analytics and proposal evaluation platform for Nouns DAO. Jihad believes that Nouns must be a center of excellence for tokenized communities, and the Explorer Grants program would be a step in the right direction in attracting the brightest minds to do focused yet unstructured work in the Nouns ecosystem. *Comp 2 ETH / month*
* **dot, technical expert:**
    * Dot is an iOS dev turned nounish builder - a founding member of Nouncil and most recently Lil Nounder at Lil Nouns DAO; the first full fork of Nouns DAO. Dot started Lil Nouns as a way to expose nouns to as many people as possible. Lil Nouns DAO leverages its 8 nouns alongside its own treasury to fund and support public goods built by lil nouners. In doing so, Lil Nouns has become a builder onramp to Nouns DAO itself. *Comp: 2 ETH / month*

***We will use a 3 of 5 multi-sig, with the core team members as well as krel and yitong.***

### Questions
**How will you actually find these builders?** Our team has fairly deep networks within the crypto and broader tech space; we'll leverage our personal connections as well as our social media presence to find more builders. Additionally, a large appeal of programs like these (Thiel Fellowship, Prop House, MacArthur Grants) is the benefit of continued funding + prestige, which we intend to lean into.

**But what if the builders don't do anything?** This is similar to everything in Nouns already - there's a social contract to uphold, someone could always dissapear after receiving 200 ETH on-chain. We can setup the grant via Sablier to revoke if a builder goes MIA, however.

**What will they actually build?** The first round will not have a particular mandate but future ones could be structured closer to Prop House mandated rounds, where there is a theme. We believe that time and freedom is key to allowing talented builders to find something meaningful to build long-term.

**Why not just run this on Prop House?** Decisions are not always best made by large committees. Prop House rounds do not allow for deep conversation and analysis of candidates. A transparent, small committee allows for depth and betting on candidates who might not otherwise get a shot (i.e. people who aren't good at writing a description on prop house but would be amazing builders). Additionally, we'd like to create a long-term relationship with these builders via an organized cohort.

**What if no good work comes out of this?** That's a possibility, as is the case with prop house rounds. However, we believe that Nouns already has a great enough brand to attract solid builders. However, if nothing goods comes out of this trial, then we will have learned that pro-active grants for attracting builders is not a valid technique for our DAO. If there are takeaways, they can be adapted into other funding sources, like Prop House or NSFW in the future.

**Why are you being paid?** Our initial proposal did not include payment for the team, but it was suggested by Nouners that we should be getting paid to create accountability, as well as allow us to dedicate more time in making this more of a full-fledged program than one-off grants with no support from us.

### Total Funding
5 Builders x 10 ETH = 50 ETH
Team Comp: 14 ETH
Total: 64 ETH

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bygv3XEIj.gif)

     
Hey Nouns DAO,

Artist and slapstick conceptualist [Marc Horowitz](http://1833marcive.com/) here, with a proposal to co-create a Nouns DAO-ified season of my new serialized NFT video collection, Worst Case Decision. It’s like Adult Swim on a dozen espresso shots, in one-minute-or-less episodes, released as 1/1 NFTs.

This is an opportunity to expand Nouns DAO culture by unleashing highly visible artist-created, community-developed CC0 video content that can be distributed everywhere. It’s also a brand-new way to use web3 tooling to release episodic videos, and an opportunity to pioneer a decentralized media production model that can help inform the future of entertainment. 
**takes a breath*

Read on and watch the below video to learn more.

[![Worst Case Decision](https://cdn.hashku.com/wcd/Nouns_WCD_Pitch_vid_screenshot_1500x.jpg)
](https://vimeo.com/772223496/a53f2e2dad ""Worst Case Decision"")


## What’s Worst Case Decision?
Worst Case Decision is maybe the first episodic “show” to be released as an NFT series.

Each season of WCD features 7 bite-sized fever dreams that are handcrafted into 30-70 second “episodes.” Every episode chases surreal characters along a bat-shit hyper-casual narrative that loosely follows a theme. So far we’ve explored themes such as “mayonnaise portal,” “everyone is wet,” “hi-fi asparagus rain,” and “too many cats,” to name a few.

The show’s vibe feels like surfing in a sea of technicolor absurdity, with a low-fi, internet-infused, stop-motion animation style. Video, painting, web3, DALL-E, comedy, commerce… WCD has it all. (Scroll to the bottom of this proposal to view sample episodes.)

**Worst Case Decision Quick Facts:**

* 50 Seasons planned, 7 episodes per season (350 episodes total)
* Episodes released episodically as 1/1 video NFTs via worstcasedecision.com
* Each season features an ever-changing cast of characters and collaborators
* NFTs can be purchased with credit card and digital currency (ETH)

## What makes this exciting for Nouns DAO?
We’re at the dawn of a new era for entertainment—one that will enable audiences and creators to build sustainable models of cultural production together. As perhaps the first-ever serialized 1/1 NFT video collection, Worst Case Decision is taking a pioneering approach to launching meme-y, weird, funny narrative shorts with and for the communities who believe this kind of art should exist in the world. 

Beyond pioneering this new web3-native episodic production model, there are a few specific benefits that Nouners can expect from supporting this project:

**Noun-ified Episodes**
The entire season will be built based on decentralized creative direction by opening up key decisions to the Nouners (and in some cases the internet at large, for max visibility). This includes community input/voting on:
* The “themes” of each episode
* Protagonists (I’ve got so many weird character ideas, man)
* Supporting cast (really, so many weird characters)
* Episode backgrounds

**CC0 Content & Nouns Memes**
The Nouns season of WCD will be entirely CC0. This means that anyone can meme the shit out of the entire season, which will be full of Nouns references, noggles, and other inside jokes specific to Nouns’ community, culture, and lore. Cut up and re-mix the episodes however y’all see fit, and post wherever you want.

**Additional Benefits to Nouns DAO**

1)	**Major marketing and PR exposure.** This is a first-of-its-kind video collection in the NFT space, and there’s “a lot of press to be had.”
2)	**WCD is planned for 50 seasons.** Nouns would be the 3rd season of 50, and the first-ever sponsored season—representing an early entry into supporting what could become a historic release.
3)	**Introduce Marc’s audience to Nouns.** I’ve been an independent artist for 25 years, and as a result I’m decently well known. I can help bring the fine art world’s attention to Nouns and web3 at large.
4)	**Reach non-web3-savvy folks, too.** Our tech partner [Hashku](https://hashku.com) has both crypto-native and custodial credit card minting solutions, meaning that non-crypto folks can participate in NFT auctions.

These are just mere examples of potential Nouns x WCD characters! Glorious, yes? Please feel free to take ‘em and make ‘em [your PFPs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ff52SL1p3PGzdxYtCO7kyA9kpE2N4EAY?usp=share_link). (Shhhh…. there will be plenty more via https://nouns.build/ in the future.) 

## What makes this exciting for Collectors?
I care immensely about my collectors. I want to add value and make the experience as fun and engaging as the episodes themselves. We have an expansive vision and are thrilled to include our collectors along this journey. 

If you are a holder of a WCD episode from any season, you’ll get access to:

* My network via a private discord channel for collectors (a seat on the board so to speak)
* Input on IRL WCD events
* Early access to future WCD collabs and projects  

## Marketing & Community Development
Our philosophy for marketing and PR follows the vision for the project. Simply put: Our weird creative vision and IRL performances are going to cause some really interesting responses, which we’ll engage with using our built-in strengths with social media and PR.

* **Launch activities** – Our team will produce strategic content and a mix of online and IRL activations to generate as much pre-launch awareness as possible. We have an existing list of interested & interesting media partners to engage here. The web3 PR agency Serotonin is among them.
*  **High-velocity engagement** – A dedicated Project Ambassador will act as a marketing strategist, online social maestro, and Nouns champion, using multi-channel engagement tactics to build momentum. 

* **Partnerships & sponsorships** – I (Marc) have a long history of partnering with brands to co-create projects. We will be bringing on some truly exciting collaborators and sponsors to spread the word even farther.

* **Long-term community growth** – Our desire is to make this project fully self-sustaining. To do this, our goal is to increase the performance of NFT auctions and overall engagement with the series by aggressively growing the WCD community. 

* **Transparent success metrics** – We will track and analyze meaningful engagement metrics to keep the community informed on how we’re doing, and to strengthen our marketing approaches overall.

## Open-Sourcing Our Promo Strategy

We wish to be as transparent as possible with our learnings about marketing and running this project. We’ll create a public document outlining our goals, metrics, successes, and learnings so that our efforts can help future projects and the community at large.

## Project Team

In addition to an amazing lineup of advisors, our core team currently consists of the following:

**Marc Horowitz** // Creator & Visionary 
**Chris Coy** // Partner & Spiritual Advisor 
**Damien Newman** // Creative Consultant & Power Supporter 
**Matt Casanova** // Builder of Technologies
**Hashku** // Minting Platform

## Budget
Anticipated activities and budgets (by phases):

* **Pre-Production** – $9,650
Studio usage, lighting equipment, episode concepting/ production planning for all 7 episodes, props, backgrounds, art department (hand making all the noggles and weird other props).

* **Production** – $16,875 
Director fee, cinematographer/camera operator fee, additional creative direction and shoot crew/collaborators, daily incidentals during shoot (food, grip, etc), and production assistance.

* **Post-Production** – $11,500 
Sound finishing/sfx/sound design, music licensing, editing, smart contract customizations for specific season NFTs, season-specific website costs (video bandwidth and hosting). 

* **Promotion of Nouns + WCD Season (Outreach/Marketing/PR)** – $17,475
Spread the word about the Nouns DAO and its sponsored season of WCD via strategic editorial write ups, podcast appearances, live events, IRL media stunts/performances, and other activations TBD.  See further notes in “Marketing Plan” (above).


**Total Budget** ($55,500) + price contingency: **50 ETH** (converted to USDC immediately) 


## Timeline & Logistics

**Mid-late February, 2023:** Launch the project with unsponsored seasons 1 and 2.

**Mid-January:** Collaborate with the Nouns community. Using voting mechanisms and other means of gathering community input, we will collectively shape WCD season 3.

**Mid-late January:** Once our Nouns season is planned, each episode takes roughly 2 days to film and edit. That brings pre-production, production, and post-production to 3-4 weeks total.

## How NFT Auctions Will Work on worstcasedecision.com
Each season of WCD video episodes will be dropped over the course of a week (dates will be announced via [@marchorowitz](https://twitter.com/marchorowitz)).
* Each day at 9am PST a new episode will drop on worstcasedecision.com
* Each episode will be released as a 1/1 NFT 
* Each NFT’s auction will end at 8:55:59 am PST the following day
* When one auction closes, the next one drops—and this continues for 7 days in a row, Mon–Sun.

## The Future of WCD and Episodic NFTs
We have the team and vision required to evolve WCD into a genre-defining series. Beyond this, we think we’re onto something in regards to how serialized NFTs can be used as a sustainable model to fund the production of some truly weird and great videos—and other creations as well.

If you are interested in learning more and chatting with Marc and the team personally, please reach out and we’ll have a chat ;)

## Thank you, Nouners!
If I get the chance to collaborate with you all, I know we can make something really fun and amazing. If you have any questions, feel free to [dm](https://twitter.com/marchorowitz) me. 

Also, if you happen to be in the Swiss Crypto Valley, I’m in a show [@unpaired__](https://twitter.com/unpaired__) NFT IRL gallery through 12/02/22 w/ [Krista Kim](https://twitter.com/Krista_Kim), [Shavonne Wong](https://twitter.com/shavonnewong_), [Pak](https://twitter.com/muratpak), [Takashi Murakami](https://twitter.com/takashipom), [Pilar Zeta](https://twitter.com/pilar_zeta), [Nancy Baker Cahill](https://twitter.com/nbakercahill), [The Haas Brothers](https://twitter.com/TheHaasBrothers), and [Urs Fischer](https://twitter.com/CHAOSursfischer).

180,Nouns Stories: Short Shorts,"# Nouns Stories: Short Shorts

![](https://i.imgur.com/mCy0tjV.png)


## TL;DR
A team of award-winning animators and executives in primetime animation have teamed up with Nouns Stories to commission 10 comedic Nouns shorts. 


---


## Short Shorts - Season 1

We're commissioning 10 shorts for 6 ETH each. 5 of the shorts will be commissioned through a Prop House round. We will hand pick, and noun pill, five of our favorite creators to complete the other 5 shorts.

**The Rules**
1. The short must be funny.
2. The short must be 15 seconds.
3. The short must feature at least one Noun.

Proposers will submit a portfolio (or at least one example of previous work) + a 1 sentence creative pitch for their short.

**Distribution**

Once the 10 shorts are complete we will plan for an entertaining online premiere, looking to collaborate with people in the Nouniverse, creators, and media outlets with established audiences. Then we will upload these to our own branded social media accounts and anywhere else on the internet that will showcase them. We will also provide the video files publically, allowing anyone to use them in future Nounish projects and news.

**Awards**

We have an additional 20 ETH to award as prizes. We'll experiment with a variety of prizes and allocation methods including token gated Nounish community votes, live celebrity critic votes, and somehow we're going to get Goldy's dog to choose one prize winner. Also included will be a prize specifically for the best CC0 shorts to incentivize creators to release their content CC0.

All of our these additional prizes will be open to public submissions - artists not selected and funded through Prop House can create their short anyways and have another shot at competing for the prizes.

**Branding**

10 ETH is included to cover basic branding needed for this Prop House round. This could include logos, a simple website, a Nouns Shorts video bumper to play between shorts, etc. We will return any ETH we do not use to the treasury.

## Funding

**Total Budget: 90 ETH**
 - Prop House Shorts Round - 30 ETH
 - Team Commissioned Shorts - 30 ETH
 - Branding Elements - 10 ETH
 - Prizes - 20 ETH

**Admin Costs**
 - 0 ETH  - the team will forgo compensation in this pilot round

**Funding Sources:**
 - **27 ETH** from Nouns Stories:
Additional funds were left over from [Prop 20](https://nouns.wtf/vote/20). For more information see this [Post in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/917252751140982885/1019989277997801512). TL;DR is Nouns Stories will deliver THE WIZARDS HAT and roll over the original funds into this new project.
- **10.69 ETH** from the Noundry Committee:
The Noundry Committee has generously decided to donate their reward from [Prop 147](https://nouns.wtf/vote/147) to help fund this round of shorts.
- **52.31 ETH** from Nouns DAO:
We are requesting the DAO match fund our existing funds to bring us to our total budget of ~90 ETH. 


The proposal requests a transfer 52.31 ETH to 0x35aa2666C8Bc0AEb68ea64B463Cf57a74bDbf977",EXECUTED,16121460,16157460,1,53,,1000000,1000,1500,532,162,0,0,['52310000000000000000'],['0x35aa2666c8bc0aeb68ea64b463cf57a74bdbf977'],[''],16107060,1670103983,0x7d5eedd397c7b4f509a7ea808579268d2718858bbcbb379e96310bff7676f430,['0x'],0x021edd67d43b365a6401a5ee704aa6f264f3f4e4
181,Nouns X Everybody,"# Nouns X Everybody

# TL;DR

This proposal will differentiate itself from other Nouns proposals aiming to create content for the Nouns (such as [165](https://nouns.wtf/vote/165), [113](https://nouns.wtf/vote/113) and [143](https://nouns.wtf/vote/143)) by focusing on creating an open process which will allow anyone to create a hype video.

While this prop is similar to [Prop 180](https://nouns.wtf/vote/180) , they are very different in their process, scope and goals. Nouns X Everybody is more about the process itself (which could be applied to other areas, not just content creation). Additionally, although this proposal pays more to the winning submissions - it is doing so because it requires the team to produce AND distribute without a guarantee of payment. While the number of views are not everything, they do matter, as we can have the highest quality content in the world but it only matters if people see it. 

Instead of determining what we think people will want to see, this proposal will instead outline the guidelines in terms of output as well as the minimum result we want achieved in terms of outcome. Leaving it open for anyone to implement their own creative process in order to achieve that result.

By funding this the proposal we would hope to achieve the goals of:


* Having a minimum of 10 pieces of original video content created, each with a minimum of 2k views on YouTube (20k total views minimum but I would expect much much more).
* Getting new and innovative ideas from both from within and outside of our existing community by allowing them creative control on the output.
* Bringing people into the Nouniverse as they will need to learn more about Nouns so as to create content which will enable them to win this challenge.
* Showcase how the various elements of the DAO (see: ‘The Process’) can be combined to create a cohesive process for project implementation.
* Demonstrating a proposal process that brings benefit to the DAO and rewards creators while not requiring compensation for the proposer. With 86% going to content creators, 12% going to marketing and just 1% going to administration along with 1% earmarked for an independent report on effectiveness of the proposal after 9 months.

# THE BRIEF

**Create a short hype video that either explains or pulls people into the Nouniverse and if your video gets over 2k views on YouTube before April 30th 2023 you could be awarded part of the $200k fund.**

The **Top 10 Videos** ranked by number of YouTube views that meet the minimum entry requirements below will be put up for a vote where **4 winners** will be selected and awarded **$50k each**.

* Any person or team is free to submit an entry to this challenge. 
* To enter, simply create your video, upload it to YouTube and get people to watch it.

___

_**MINIMUM QUALIFYING CRITERIA**_ 

- Has more than 2000 organic views on Youtube by the end of the Submission Period
- Must meet the brief (i.e. It either ‘explains the Nouns’ or ‘pulls people into the Nouniverse’)
- Content must be original. While videos may reuse existing content if it is not mostly original it will not qualify.
- Is positive in nature and is rated PG
- Must be a video and not a YouTube ""shorts""
- Should include ‘#EnterTheNouniverse’ in the description (so we can easily filter submissions)


---

Complete creative freedom is given to entrants on how they want to achieve the goal – it can be animated, live footage, a mixture of both or something completely different. Some teams might focus on higher end productions that explains Nouns to people while others might focus on something simple and unique that pulls people into the Nouniverse (i.e. see the different approach[ Coinbase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJ9pNQrz0fA&ab_channel=AnthonyKalamut) had vs other cypto companies during the superbowl in trying to achieve the same result). It is up to the creator to do what they think will work.



---
&nbsp;

## SELECTION CRITERIA

The **Top 8 Videos with the most views on YouTube + 2 Videos chosen by the Selection Committee** will be entered into the Voting Round – where Noun holders will vote for the 4 winners of $50k each.



* All videos must meet the minimum qualification criteria
* Selected entries will be free to provide any additional information at this stage to be included in their entry which demonstrates why their content should win (for example, data from other social media platforms like Twitter, TikTok or any other measure of engagement)
* Selected entries may be asked to provide information to the selection committee proving that their YouTube views were organic that the data has not been manipulated or paid for.
* A person/team can submit as many entries as they want but only their best entry (which they can choose)  will be selected for the final vote.
* We are including 2 videos selected by the committee due to the fact that some entries may not be in the Top 10 in terms of views of YouTube but may have merit for nomination through a disproportionate level of engagement on other channels and/or be of exceptional quality or have uploaded their video late in the process but has gained a lot of views in a short time period.

# THE PROCESS

If this proposal is successful, the following process will take place:



1. **Proposal Passes:** $200k and 25 Eth with be transferred to a multisig controlled by the Multisig. The challenge has officially started.
2. **Submission Period:** There is a 5 Month window for anyone to create and publish their hype video.
3. **Create Marketing Dept:** 25 Eth will immediately be used to fund a Prop House Round with 5 Eth being awarded to the 5 best proposals detailing how they will market and find entrants for this project. (see note at bottom)
4. **Selection Period:** When the submission period has ended on April 30th 2023 there will be a 2 week selection period where the creators of the Top 10 videos will be invited by the Selection Committee to make their submissions. These submissions, including any additional information the creator wants to provide, will be uploaded to a Prop House round by the Selection Committee.The selection committee will be paid 3 eth for administering this.
5. **Voting Round:** Nouns will have a 1 week voting period to cast their votes for the 4 winning submissions to be awarded $50k each.
6. **Payment:** Funds will be distributed to the Winners by the Trusted Parties.
7. **Analysis**: 2 eth will be earmarked for an indpedent evaluation of this proposal after 9 months. To see how effective it was at achieving the stated outcome. 

_**Important Note:** If no one meets the minimum qualifying criteria, the Nouns pay nothing (with the exception of the 25 eth used to fund the marketing dept prop house round) and all funds are returned to the Treasury. But for every person or team that does meet the criteria, we have at the very least a piece of original video content with more that 2k views on YouTube._ 




** **

**Selection Committee:** The Selection committee will be comprised of 5 independent members of the Noun community, selected by Hindsight, whose job it will be: (a) select the Top 10 videos to be included in the final Noun vote as per the minimum qualifying criteria and the selection criteria above, (b) contact these creators to submit any additional information for the final vote and (c) upload those submissions to a Prop House vote.

The work of the selection committee is minimal and mostly administrative (checking that views are organic etc) and as such will only require 3 eth (of which I will get none).

_In order to maintain independence and to ensure a fair process members of the selection committee cannot enter a video to the challenge_


---

**Stated Goals of this Proposal** 
If this proposal passes, it success or failure will be measured against meeting the following criteria:
* The creation of a minimum of 10 pieces of good quality, original content before April 30th
* A minimum of 100k cumulative organic YouTube views across all content created in persuit of this prize before 9 months of this proposal passing
___



**Team** 
Really the point of this prop is that there is no 'team' but for the interest of transparency and to include a section I think should be in all props:
* Hindsight: I am not a member of any other teams, councils or projects and I do not receive any compensation from any DAO source. I have no conflicts of interest and will not financially benefit from this proposal.
* My only role will be to be on the multisig and to choose the selection commitee (A role I would be happy to give to someone else if they are suitable and want it!)


---

**Transaction Details**



* 30 Eth will be transferred to fund a Prop House Round to create a marketing team for the challenge, the selection committee administration cost and the retrospective report on outcome.
* $200k USD will be transferred to fund the prize pool.

_If less than 4 teams do not meet the minimum qualifying criteria then any USDC that has not been used will be returned to the treasury._

**Total Cost:** $200k + 30 Eth

**Multisig**

The multisig is a 3/5 consisting of the 5 best looking members of the dao

* [Elad](https://twitter.com/eladmallel)
* [Jarmen](https://twitter.com/jarmen43)
* [Maty](https://twitter.com/matyETH)
* [Adrianmcli](https://twitter.com/adrianmcli)

___

**A note on the 'Marketing Dept' creation**


The prop house round for 25 eth will award 5 submissions 5 eth to market this challenge and try and find people and teams outside both inside and outside of Nouns to make submissions. I will draft the prop house round if this proposal succeeds. An idea of submissions that will be encouraged are: contacting media schools, creating a landing pages with instructions, engaging with influencers to promote etc. 

___


**Why YouTube Views**


As stated earlier, YouTube views are not everything, but they do matter and after looking at the view count of Nouns content I think we could benefit from a proposal with a proposal that has goals in terms of distribution as well as production. 

Many of these videos will have more views on Twitter and other platforms and I would expect the same from any video created for this challenge. But for the interest of managing the proposal we will have to set one medium as the primary one for measurement and I think YouTube is the most appropriate.

2k views to reach the minimum entry requirement may seem small, and it is, but remember this is a MINIMUM, and we would expect any video that qualifies in the Top 10 to have many more views than that. 

Here you can see how many views Nounish content is currently getting on YouTube
[![YT-V.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/XYSbwxm9/YT-V.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bsTWP0zv)

While some content that that use gimmicks, shows a lack of creativity nor effort, or does not show a clear comprehension of what the Nouns ecosystem is may meet the minimum qualifying criteria (whether due to the creator having large existing YouTube following or otherwise), ultimately the winning pieces of content be decided upon by a Nouner vote and so are extremely unlikely to be awarded anything for their efforts. So anyone who creates a video with the expectation of success should keep it classy and keep it Nounish.

## **VALUE PROPOSITION**

The Snap filters I created previously were used by the Dota2 Esport team (See [Grand Finals livestream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1312698913)), the Noun Square team (see [PropHouse winners interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOP8N49QBTc)), Nounish videos (currently in production) and can be seen in some on-chain proposals and memes across Twitter and Discord. 

There is an increasing demand for Nounish content creation tools, and I often get the question: **""Wen my Noun in AR?"".**

We are in the media propagation phase of Nouns, and with the expectation of AR-VR glasses becoming a main computational platform in the near future, Nouns should be AR-ready.

I propose to craft an initial set of 50 heads as expressive Augmented Reality filters, with responsive eyes, mouth, and eyebrows motion, as well as fun animations, depending on each Noun (e.g. a dripping brush, a fin flapping shark etc).

These filters will be simultaneously published on Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok.

Nouns AR filters can be used for :
* Nounish Videos / interviews / social reels
* Live streaming / podcasts
* Undoxxed video calls
* Memes and GIFs. See my Tenor page https://tenor.com/users/coralorca

## **SCOPE: TIKTOK + INSTAGRAM + SNAP**

I initially received funding from NSFW to create the AR glasses on Snapchat, then won two Prophouse rounds ([round 5](https://prop.house/nouns/round-5/498) and [round 7](https://prop.house/nouns/round-7/860)) which funded 8 additional filters bringing the total on Snapchat to 13.

The frog head has been ported to TikTok and Instagram as a feasibility test.


For this proposal I will create: 


**- 50 Noun heads on TikTok with the ability to switch between the 23 glasses colors using a simple screen tap.**
Creating these requires [Effect House](https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/), TikTok’s AR filter authoring tool.

**- 50 Noun heads on Instagram with the ability to switch between the 23 glasses colors using a simple screen tap.**
Creating these requires [SparkAR](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio), Meta’s AR filter authoring tool.

**- 37 additional Noun heads on Snapchat (bringing the total published on Snapchat to 50) with the ability to switch between 23 glasses colors using a simple screen tap.** 
Creating these requires [Studio Lens](https://ar.snap.com/lens-studio), Snap's AR filter authoring tool.

Snap Lenses are particularly interesting because they:
- Integrate seamlessly with Discord, Zoom, Twitch, Google Hangout, OBS etc. using the free [Snap Camera](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/) desktop application. See this [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWIZn\_-oFig) I made if you want to learn how to do it.
- Have advanced face tracking features with seamless animations

## **PROCESS**

![](https://imgur.com/dsON2XB.jpeg)

###### Consistency across the different authoring software: Snap’s *Lens Studio*, Meta’s *SparkAR*, and TikTok’s *Effect House*.

I have been optimizing this pipeline for some time, and each trait needs custom animations depending on its shape. The geometry has to be considered individually, and some traits are more challenging than others. This is a similar process to what I went through when translating all 2D Nouns to 3D voxels with 3Dnouns.com. You can speed up the pipeline with work habits and experience, but each head requires specific attention to craft the Nounish details that make the difference.

## **METRICS**
I will share metrics from the different social platforms with the community.
Here are some metrics from the Snapchat filters created with Prophouse funding and some recently published filters on TikTok.

#### TIKTOK
![](https://imgur.com/Qdb7oSX.jpeg)
###### Close to 20k plays in two weeks with 0 marketing.

#### SNAPCHAT

![](https://imgur.com/PFoW7Ri.jpeg)

###### The Robot Noun’s head has almost 600k plays in November! This is an interesting case of side effect proliferation. 

![](https://imgur.com/T1NMuqt.jpeg)

###### BudLight was the first filter created, and currently totals over 4k plays.





## **PORTING MODELS TO INSTAGRAM AND TIKTOK**
I will import the 50 models to Meta’s and TikTok’s AR authoring software (respectively *SparkAR* and *Effect House*) to publish them to Instagram, Messenger, Facebook, and TikTok and reach a wider audience. 
Regarding the workflow, the 3D assets will be re-used, however, they still need to be imported, positioned, scaled, lit and the animation triggers need to be configured on an individual basis and depending on each software capabilities. 
From a technical standpoint Snap Lens Studio > SparkAR > TikTok Effect house. My goal is to make each Noun head as consistent as technically possible across all different platforms. See Frog head above.

## **WHICH NOUN AND WHEN**
I will deliver between 10 and 20 heads per month, released on the three platforms simultaneously as they are created. I will create community requested heads first, and otherwise will craft the traits that I think will be the most successful. 
👉Here is an open To-do if you want to add your favorite traits to the list:

![](https://imgur.com/lrjR7ac.jpeg)

###### Potential AR Filters candidates 

## **COMPENSATION**
For the Prophouse winning rounds, I suggested 4 filters for 2 ETH, when ETH was around 1800-2000 USD. The market price for such 3D AR lenses sits between 1500-5000 USD per filter. 
For reference, [this MAYC filter I created](https://www.instagram.com/ar/1025321405001469/) was commissioned by LollaPalooza for Snapchat and IG and was around 5k USD - It is a little more complex with many eyes and snot coming out of the nose.

With ETH currently around 1200 USD, I adjusted the price to 3 filters for 2 ETH, around 800 USD.

- Setting up the geometry and creating the expressions system for each of the 37 heads in Blender.
**(37/3) * 2 = 24.7**

- Porting the geometry to TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, setting up the animation triggers and publishing to these platform with consistent tagging and video previews.
I am estimating this work at 0.18 ETH per filter for a total of 137 filters.
**(50 on TikTok + 50 on Instagram + 37 on Snapchat) * 0.18 = 24.7**

This brings the total ask at **49.4 ETH** with an average price of 0.36 ETH per filter.

***tl;dr:**
We’ve reached the one year mark since the inception of the idea for Prop House! Over that time period, Prop House has become a core piece of infrastructure for the development of the Nouns ecosystem – onboarding a sizable percentage of the most impactful builders while spreading the Nouns meme far and wide. We are requesting 570 ETH to continue to fund development of Prop House over the next 6 months (Jan ‘23 - Jun ‘23).*

---

***State of the Prop House(s):**
On Dec 1st, 2022, Seneca hosted an open call to update the community on what we’ve been up to since the [proposal #105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105). You can view the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TbJsbXWCPxbMyE25Xr_kfQjJJYMtGw0HEYuLrtdkndI/edit?usp=sharing) and recording of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD9v1ihIRmw).*

## Onboarding builders
The most important outcome of Prop House for Nouns has been its ability to onboard a large percentage of the most impactful builders in the ecosystem. **More than funding, the core feature of Prop House is about activating builders**. Whether it be for folks who had never heard of Nouns before or those who were just hanging around, Prop House was the mechanism that took them from inactive to building within the ecosystem.

Given Nouns is about bottom-up brand building as opposed to top-down centralized direction, we hope that Prop House can continue to serve as a tool to execute on that Nouns vision. Below is a list of some of the builders who’ve been activated by Prop House:

![](https://i.imgur.com/2ZeeWk9.png)

## Where we are today by the numbers
Our last proposal ([#105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105)) passed on July 18, 2022. Since then, we’ve made substantial progress on all core Prop House KPIs:

![](https://i.imgur.com/JtrkRUm.png)

All our charts are seeing sustained month-over-month growth despite market downturns:

![](https://i.imgur.com/jr1bwSR.jpg)

The funnel from prop award to prop completion has maintained a high conversion rate. Close to 85% of all prop winners go on to complete their proposed work. Below is an analysis on all prop winners from all funding rounds within the [Nouns house](https://prop.house/nouns) (18 funding rounds and 105 awarded proposals):

![](https://i.imgur.com/H71CV2j.jpg)

## Spreading the Nouns meme
Over the past 5 months we’ve onboarded several communities, most notably [Meebits](https://prop.house/meebits) via [Ape Coin DAO funding](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-110-meebits-prophouse-sponsored-by-apecoin/8219). By doing so, Prop House has spread the Nouns meme far beyond our immediate community. In tandem with Prop House growth comes furthering the reach of the Nouns meme along with what Nouns stands for: building.

![](https://i.imgur.com/nTQsPIo.jpg)

## Product
The Prop House team has been busy working on the core product ([prop.house](https://prop.house)). A brief summary of what we’ve done follows:

- Contracted one the best designers in the space (0xHab from Rainbow)
- Revamped UI across the entire app
- Implemented multi-round houses
- Upgraded voting UX
- Open sourced the [repository](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/).
- Released a [GraphQL interface](https://prod.backend.prop.house/graphql) for Prop House data which lead to projects like [NounsAtlas](https://nounsatlas.com), [Voters.wtf](https://voters.wtf) and [Nounish.cv](https://nounish.netlify.app/)

## Protocol
We’ve also made strides in the development of the Prop House protocol.

The protocol leverages both Ethereum and Starknet in an effort to provide the best possible user experience. This dual-chain architecture enables Prop House users to propose and vote by signing a message, while decentralizing the entire funding flow.

We use Ethereum as the operations and execution layer, where houses are managed and payouts are made, while Starknet handles all user actions that occur within a funding round.

All of the code is publicly available today in the [Prop House repository](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/tree/protocol).

Below are some of the core pieces of infrastructure we’ve developed to support the protocol, where we are currently, and what to expect as we near mainnet launch:

- The [protocol](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/tree/protocol/packages/prop-house-contracts) itself, which has been deployed to Goerli.
- The [Prop House SDK](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/tree/protocol/packages/prop-house-sdk), which simplifies interaction with the protocol (L1 & L2).
- The Starknet Relayer, which is responsible for submitting signed proposals and votes to Starknet on behalf of users.
- Ethereum & Starknet subgraphs, which are currently in development.
- Current blockers:
    - [Cairo V1 Migration](https://medium.com/starkware/open-sourcing-cairo-1-0-b3100a664bb0)
    - [Support for V1 on StarkNet](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-regenesis-the-plan-bd0219843ef4) (expected Q1 ‘23)
    - Protocol audits (pending testing on testnet)

Assuming no major hiccups, we aim to deploy the protocol to mainnet before the end of Q1 2023.

## Financials
*The Prop House financials doc is publicly available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iKGgedZmAzMNCFkd2PqjBd-ZgutrOjuYqfirDG1wS3g/edit?usp=sharing)*

Over the course of one year and three proposals ([#23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23), [#62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62), [#105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105)), Nouns DAO has funded the Prop House team 555 ETH for deploying towards Nouns builders and 695 ETH for development and operating expenses.

![](https://i.imgur.com/oxC4c8l.png)

*Note: current burn rate for Nouns funding rounds is low (~20-30 ETH / mo). If at any point the DAO chooses to have another party deploy Nouns House Funding, we will return all remaining funds to the DAO.*

## What’s next?
### Protocol launch
We are aiming for a mainnet launch by the end of Q1 2023. What follows is the timeline we are executing against to get to launch:

- Migrate to Cairo V1
- Complete Goerli testing
- Finalize Prop House SDK & Starknet Relayer
- Launch subgraphs for Ethereum & Starknet
- Developer documentation
- Protocol audit

### Product development
Alongside the transition to the protocol as the data layer, we will continue to develop the UX of app:
- Core UX: better proposing, discovery and voting user experiences.
- The launch of house and round managers such that anyone can create a house, deposit funds and initiate funding rounds.
- Implementation for infinite rounds for grant pods to run their entire operation via Prop House.
- Develop social features for communities. 

## Sustainability
There are several avenues to explore on how to make Prop House sustainable. For the time being, we are continuing to pursue funding by Nouns DAO as we believe it to be a positive sum engagement. Below we dive into potential avenues:

### Nouns DAO funded (current)
To date, Nouns DAO has funded development costs of Prop House over the past ~12 months (695 ETH). For the current model to continue to work, Nouners would have to agree that the value created for Nouns by Prop House is higher than that of the development costs. In this framing, Nouns DAO is a patron to Prop house where its ROI is the onboarding of high impact builders, the attention generated by Prop House as public infrastructure by Nouns DAO and it being infrastructure for Nouns to run on.

### Fees for usage
The true and tried approach is turning on fees at the client and/or protocol. This approach would require a substantial increase in volume (to the order of about 50-100x) to maintain current burn rates. So while feasible, it is not a solution for the short term. 

### Experimental
**Nounish DAO**
In prop [#105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105), we posed Prop House DAO as a plausible avenue to making Prop House sustainable. While it is still a potential route, there are concerns as to whether or not the DAO makes sense at all. At the core of it is whether the Nouns DAO format is appropriate for non-purely meme driven protocols. There’s also the question of whether every protocol needs a DAO and a corresponding governance token. So while the DAO is not out of the question, we believe that with experiments like [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build/), the answer will become clearer over time. 
**Pure Meme NFTs**
There’s a case to be made where Prop House NFTs are minted to hold provenance value. This alone could capture long-term upside in the same way a visual artist and their collectors do. 

## Funding Request
570 ETH to fund development of Prop House protocol & client over the next 6 months (Jan ‘23 - Jun ‘23). 
- 486 ETH: 3 engineers, 1 designer and 1 all hats.
- 84 ETH for OpEx including contractors, infra, audits, bounties, translators, etc.

------

[@ZachXBT](https://twitter.com/zachxbt) is a public good serving the crypto ecosystem through tireless research exposing [countless scams](https://investigations.notion.site/). Recent events have highlighted the dire need and importance of such work. This prop proposes to fund 100 ETH to their donation address: zachxbt.eth (address can be verified from their twitter profile).

Donations have always been somewhat controversial within Nouns governance. [Prop 21](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) donating 169 ETH to Gitcoin grants was one of the most contentious votes in our early history. [Prop 108](https://nouns.wtf/vote/108) donating 500 ETH to Ethereum protocol development (via the Protocol Guild) was much more unanimous but still there was discomfort and discourse around whether the DAO was becoming ""a tax inefficient way for DAO members to make donations.""

I agree that we shouldn't resort to becoming a complacent vehicle of passive philanthropy. We should instead aim to actively contribute and be a net producer of public goods ourselves such that our meme (brand) can fully capture the provenance value (claim on originality of) the public work and thus leverage the virtuous cycle to do more than what capital alone could have done. However, there should be exceptions to this rule if there is an urgent and common public cause that warrants highlighting. I would like to suggest that this is such a case. Crypto needs more validators like ZachXBT.

With donations we need to be extra wary of conflicts of interest or self-dealing. Unfortunately there is no way to prove this cryptographically, but I attest that I have no prior (or planned future) relationship with ZachXBT and that today was the first time I contacted them (via twitter) to ask for their permission to make this proposal.",EXECUTED,16155738,16191738,1,55,,1000000,1000,1500,537,185,2,0,['100000000000000000000'],['0x9d727911b54c455b0071a7b682fcf4bc444b5596'],[''],16141338,1670518763,0x737527b043841f7ef905c3351e8073f3bedc5a32f2ca1ac576995928e0c892b8,['0x'],0xa555d1ee16780b2d414ed97f4f169c0740099615

## Intro:
[Prop 57](https://nouns.wtf/vote/57) funded the creation of 8,250 pairs of luxury sunglasses made by Nouns Vision.  Approximately 560 of those have been sold to individuals.*

As per the on-chain proposal, 500 tokens of Nouns Vision NFT's (each redeemable for an individual pair of physical glasses) were transferred to the Nouns DAO treasury. 

## Proposal: 

The authors of this proposal are asking the DAO, on behalf of the communities they represent (Nouns Esports, Gnars, The Noun Square), for an allocation of these sunglasses to be used to further proliferate Nouns DAO as well as help market and drive new buyers towards Nouns Vision.

By distributing these tokens across various sub-communities, we can further proliferate Nouns through physical interactions with the highest quality noggles available.

The undersigned sub-communities of Nouns DAO are asking for fifty Nouns Vision tokens each (150 total) from the Nouns treasury in order to continue their efforts of proliferation.

- [The Noun Square](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare)
    - Proposed use: Media appearances from hosts, and distribution via giveaways on Twitter and YouTube, including as prizes for a planned Nouns DAO Awards Show in December.
- [Nouns Esports](https://twitter.com/nounsesports)
    - Proposed use: Primarily the pairs will be kept on retainer and esports operators will coordinate with players to have them used in prominent competitive-gaming events or live-streaming opportunities. Additionally, a portion will be distributed as gaming competition prizes.
- [Gnars](https://twitter.com/gnars_dao)
    - Proposed use: Extreme athletes could wear these in social media posts, at IRL events, and in interviews. All of which have high potential for visibility, especially outside of the Nouns ecosystem.

Conversation towards this effort has already been taking place in the #57-sunglasses channel of the Nouns Discord server.

# **TLDR**

We're requesting 340 ETH for 6 months to continue building [House of Nouns](https://twitter.com/houseofnouns), a supercharged platform + context layer for Nouns governance. We want to make governance participation fun. 

Our vision is to create a governance platform that is both delightful and easy to use, empowering voters to effectively govern NounsDAO. The client is being created on top of an upcoming open-source framework, built by nounish developers, for nounish developers.

# Current progress

We've had early success with [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.wtf/), with many Nouners and non-Nouners alike expressing their love of the intuitive interface. We want to continue building on this success and make it easier for people to participate in governance in an engaging way.

![Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 9.40.34 PM.png](https://imgur.com/D7F1Q0a.png)

Not familiar with House of Nouns? You can discuss proposals with others, view important context, and vote all in one intuitive interface on [https://houseofnouns.wtf](https://houseofnouns.wtf). 

**Some data:** 

- MAUs - growing 100% month / month
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-12-08 at 7.03.38 PM.png](https://imgur.com/aKCSwBO.png)
    
- Working with Nouns, Lil Nouns, and Gnars. In talks with many more communities.
    
    [https://houseoflilnouns.wtf](https://houseoflilnouns.wtf/proposals/69)
    
    [https://gnars.house](https://gnars.house) 
    
- ~13.5% registered-user market penetration
    - 170 registered users / 1263 total members in Nouns (delegates + Nouners + anyone who has voted or made a proposal on-chain or in Prop House)

# **Core vision and goals**

Our vision is to make it easier for voters to participate in Nouns governance by providing rich context, intuitive conversation tools, and seamless integrations with other Nounish platforms. This will be built on top of an open framework, empowering developers and solving impactful problems specific to nounish governance. 

In short:

- Provide all context on proposals, voters, builders, and team members, and view all conversations from Discord, Twitter, and Discourse in one place
- Build a custom forum client directly into HoN that is backwards compatible w/Discourse, allowing users to create and discuss proposal drafts and get early feedback
- Provide first-class support for Nouns forks and Prop House, and deeper integrations with Atlas, Federation and Agora
- Create the open source House of Nouns framework, serving core data displayed on the site through a GraphQL API, paired with a developer friendly SDK for building on top of House of Nouns infrastructure

## Product Breakdown

### **Context layer**

We will attach more information to proposals, such as FAQs, comments, relevant links, conversations from other platforms, video attachments, and more. We're currently working with @maty.eth on integrating data from [proposals.wtf](http://proposals.wtf). 

![Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 1.20.48 PM.png](https://imgur.com/NWxsu7o.png)

We also will provide more context on Nouners, builders, and team members, such as their past proposals, voting record, and Agora profile, directly in HoN. 

![Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 9.35.06 PM.png](https://imgur.com/b8zipr3.png)

After a proposal is executed, we will make it easy to see what has been delivered as a result.

### Forums + conversation stack

We're building an alternative forum client like Discourse that pulls data from Discourse, and integrates token signaling and Ethereum-based identities. This will be built into House of Nouns and will allow users to create and discuss proposal drafts, get early feedback, and graduate drafts to proposals. It will also provide context on builders and [members](https://collective.xyz/nouns/members), and allow token-based voting.

![Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 1.19.55 PM.png](https://imgur.com/oXSPL8Y.png)

We also want to provide more intuitive ways to get early community consensus, such as upvote/idea boards. This will allow users to easily move from an idea to a draft proposal, get comments, and then move to an on-chain proposal with ongoing comments and voting.

### Integrations

Deeper integrations with other Nounish products like Nouns Atlas and Nouns Agora. 

View conversation from Discord, Twitter, Discourse etc. in-line on [houseofnouns.wtf](http://houseofnouns.wtf). 

First class support for Nouns forks, Prop House, Federation, and other governance sources

- one-click governance clients for Nouns forks
- vote on Prop House rounds directly in HoN with intuitive and easy UI
- Federation integration (ex: vote on HoN as a Gnars holder)

While we will make sure our infrastructure can support all Nounish communities, we will focus on solving problems specific to Nouns governance in the next 6 months. We believe this is where we can have the biggest impact.

## House of Nouns Framework

We are building an open source framework to give builders the tools they need to build custom governance and discussion experiences for their communities. We will build House of Nouns on top of this framework, in a similar vein to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) being both a builder and end-user of NextJS. 

The main components of the framework are:

Open access to core data displayed on the site through a GraphQL API.

React [SDK](https://github.com/collectivexyz/sdk) for developing on top of House of Nouns infrastructure, including hooks to access data, pre-built components etc. 

## Differentiation

Agora approaches the problem of low governance participation from the delegation perspective. Don’t want to vote? Delegate to someone to do it for you. 

House of Nouns approaches it from the conversation and context-aggregation perspective.  Empowering Nouners to vote independently and be empowered to think for themselves. 

Both approaches are valid and necessary for the ecosystem to grow. We will be working closely with Agora to ensure we don’t build the same things and otherwise waste valuable energy. 

## Success Metrics

Our goal is to have 30% or more of the Nounish ecosystem using (voting/discussing/viewing) House of Nouns *every week*. Currently, about 14% are registered users. We believe that with further improvements to the proposal conversation stack and better user experience, we can reach this goal. 

Ultimately, our goal is to have the House of Nouns framework and SDK integrated into 10 or more clients by July 2023.

We will use these as the two primary metrics to evaluate our success in 6 months.

# **Transparency & decentralization**

As a governance platform, we want to avoid centralization of power by taking the following measures:

- Building the House of Nouns framework as an open source public good
    - Offer up all data through APIs and a developer friendly SDK
    - Transition discussion data to open data layers as soon as an attractive option has wide adoption / traction
    - Offer a React SDK for components and data fetching
- Current House of Nouns team members added together will commit to not represent more than 5% of NounsDAO.

Our goal is to open-source the core building blocks of governance and discussion, and provide killer developer tooling on top of the HoN rails so anyone can build custom experiences for their communities and subcultures. 

## Sustainability

We plan to generate revenue by offering bespoke upgrades to other DAOs similar to Red Hat, as well as charging hosting costs for larger communities. Our goal is for the HoN client to become self-sustainable within 12-16 months. These upgrades will be built into the broader platform and framework for all users. 

For the HoN framework, we’re exploring alternative public goods funding routes (Nouns model, Gitcoin etc.) so we can be empowered to continue building something maximally useful for the entire ecosystem.

## TL;DR

We’re aiming to bring Nouns to life by animating all Nouns assets as public goods for cc0 use. We'll build tools for users to generate & access their own animations quickly and easily for use in any project. There's 20 unique and thoughtfully crafted animations to choose from with over 467,000,000 possible animation outcomes.

* Through a front-end app, anyone can enter a Noun ID or mix and match traits to create their own custom Noun and export animations on the spot.
* Developers will be able to programmatically access any of these animations instantly and seamlessly through an API and/or a URL.
* Interact with your Noun (including custom ones) through an interactive app on a daily basis with actions like eating, sleeping, playing, and more! The status of each Noun will change throughout the day and you can tend to it accordingly to keep it alive, happy, and healthy.

## Introduction & Background
---
Hello Everyone,

I'm Jeff (aka heyjeff.eth, jefe) and I’ve been developing an app over the past year that aims to engage NFT collectors by bringing their NFTs to life. Quick backstory:

The concept was inspired by the popular Japanese phenomenon ‘Tamagotchi’ released in the late 90’s. Each handheld device contains a virtual friend the user must tend to in order to keep it alive, happy, and healthy. Interestingly enough, it’s a style of game that you don’t necessarily ‘beat’ or ‘win’. It’s more of an experience of having a buddy that you can play with, care for, and watch grow throughout it’s lifespan, forever.

I thought it’d be fun if people could do the same with their NFTs, so I decided to build a prototype. At first it started out as just a silly napkin sketch, but now we’re proud to say we’ve recently finished adding support for all 6,969 CrypToadz, each with 11 unique animations totaling over 75,000 files! *(That’s 7.6 GB of raw toad data)*. For those who own a CrypToad, you can check out the app [here](https://tinycitizen.xyz).

Here’s some footage:
[![CrypToadz Gameplay](https://i.imgur.com/KHs4MZi.png)](https://vimeo.com/780511900)


## Motivation and Goals
---
What we’re aiming to do is leverage the tech we’ve developed for CrypToadz and adapt it to build tools so that anyone can generate, access, and download Nounish animations on demand for cc0 use.

To do this, we’ll develop an easy-to-use Build-a-Noun app through which anyone can choose a pre-existing Noun or build their own by mixing and matching traits at will or at random. Users will be able to preview animations on the fly and then instantly download any or all of the animations they like, with the option of exporting the individual animation frames as well. The app is future-proofed too, so every Noun that is born each day will be readily accessible.

Not only that, but any animation for any Noun configuration can be easily accessible via a back-end API and/or a URL for developers to use in their web apps instantly and seamlessly.

As an added bonus, anyone can immediately interact and play with their Noun or custom Noun through our other interactive app we’ve already built!

Ultimately, the goal of all of this is to empower people to actively use Nouns in engaging, refreshing, and easy ways to help spread the meme.

## Build-A-Noun App, prototype & poc
(early prototype shown, does not represent final product)
[![Build-A-Noun Prototype](https://i.imgur.com/Viv5UfU.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/777492078)

The 20 total actions and states are: idle (breathing/blinking), happy/loved, laughing, talking, dancing/head bob, eating: pizza, mushroom, veggies, fruit, hamburger, playing a gameboy, sad/crying, drinking: coffee, water, tea, health/mana potion, tired, sick, and sleeping.

The above is an early prototype solely to convey the concept of the Build-A-Noun app. The final product will have a redesigned and intuitive interface, with way more options and functionality, such as:
* Select transparent or any background color (hex or rbg input)
* Quick select any existing Noun ID config
* Searchable traits by ID or name
* Randomize traits button
* Flip the animation (left-facing vs right-facing)
* Change output animation speed
* Apply an rbg tint to the animation
* Apply a black and white filter to the animation
* Resize animation to specific dimensions
* Export all individual frames for a given animation
* Pick and choose which animations to export
* Add text overlays
* Share-to-Twitter button to quickly tweet your creations

*Examples of animation customization options*

In total, we’d pre-generate 8,700 animation files (435 Nouns assets x 20 unique states), each with an average of 30 frames per animation. That's  a total of 261,000 individual frames to bring this vision to life! There are 23,377,200 possible combinations for a Noun, and 467,544,00 possible animations outcomes (23,377,200 x 20)!


## Why?
---
Currently, there isn't a scalable tool in the Nouniverse that allows users to quickly produce a wide range of highly customizable Nounish cc0 animations on demand.

Game developers, content creators, and everyday users can benefit from such a tool as a building block to create even bigger and more Nounish things!

We're trying to fill this gap in the Nounscape by providing STOMMs (*Super Tool of Mass-Memeification*) in an area that is lacking. With this tool in place, I believe we'll see an explosion of new Nounish content for everyone to use and enjoy as they see fit.

Plus, being able to interact with your Noun deepens our emotional connection to them!

## Sneak Peeks
---
We made the following animations for Lil Nouns for fun as a test, but the same concepts apply for Nouns. Here's a peek at 10 out of the 20 total states. Choose any background color you like, or none at all (transparent).

## Interactive App ~ Bonus ~
---
Anyone who owns a Noun or builds one with our Noun Builder app can interact with it on a daily basis through an app we've already built (works on mobile too)! Each Noun will be animated to reflect it's current state or action - it will truly feel like your Noun has come to life!

Here are the following mechanics:

4 Stats (each max val of 100):
* Fullness
* Energy
* Happiness
* Health

3 Player Actions (each grants XP needed in order to level up):
* Feeding – Increases fullness and happiness
* Sleeping – Increases energy and health
* Playing – Increases happiness, decreases fullness and energy

3 Conditions:
* Can’t sleep while starving
* Can’t play while sleep-deprived
* Can’t eat while sick

3 Items (purchasable with points earned from completing actions)
* Coffee – Triples the amount of XP gained, but cannot sleep for 8 hr
* Health Potion – Replenishes health to full
* Mushroom (can be easily reskinned to another object) – 1 of 4 potential effects, chosen at random:
    * Jumbles stats at random
    * Earn a random amount of XP
    * Gain 1 level
    * Eat a poisonous mushroom and die
* All stats decay by 2 every 4 hours automatically, forever
* Sometimes, at random, 1 of the 4 stats will be depleted to zero if all stats are non-zero
* If neglected for ~8 days, the NFT will die
* NFTs can be revived, but lose 1 level and costs points
* Highest levels are ranked in a public leaderboard

## How is this valuable to Nouns??
---

### 1. Public Goods & Network Effects

Everyone from experienced devs to everyday users will be able to generate & access Nounish animations on demand, either through the API or the front-end tool within a few clicks.

This means anyone -- enthusiasts, developers, and/or content creators can save countless hours by bootstrapping these animations to be used any way they like! Some examples include: 

* Enrich existing apps or websites
* Use as stickers and/or emojis for Discord servers
* Use the animations to develop a game
* Use them to make merch and/or NFTs
* Enhance Nounish media like tweets, infographics, or videos
* Use as pfps
* Download the individual animation frames to make sprite sheets
* Use the frame data to create lip-synced animated avatars for video/audio calls

-- the possibilities are endless!

The end result will lead to quicker turnarounds for prototypes and media creations, and act as a catalyst for the proliferation of new Nounish content overall.

Quote from devcarrot, Nounder:
""This sounds like a very fun idea, I love the animations. Would you be willing to make the data accessible to other developers via a public API? Maybe with something like a license that requires attribution? It could be interesting to have Nounish characters hanging out on the various projects’ sites; imagine Timpers’ disco floor but with TinyCitizen characters rendered in real time.

The disco floor:

### 2. Rally community around organic and fun reward systems

Through the interactive app we’ve already built, it provides opportunities for users to earn rewards through quests.

As an example, we’ve successfully rewarded 80+ unique CrypToadz players with a CrypToadz hat and pair of Nouns glasses to those who reached level 10 with a CrypToad through the interactive app. Everyone shared how much they loved this event!

This provides a more rewarding experience because the merch drop felt earned rather than simply given. In turn, it promotes camaraderie and a sense of fellowship among the community who want to achieve a mutual desired result by partaking in shared experiences.

Any Nounish DAO that wishes to engage their audience can task their community with completing certain actions through the app and granting them an award upon completion.

**Reward bundle: CrypToadz Hat + Noun Glasses + NFT NYC Coaster**

![](https://i.imgur.com/f8PToWz.jpg)

*pssst… This event is still ongoing! If you want a CrypToadz hat and Nouns glasses you can still grind for them! Find me on Discord :wink:*

### 3. Tap into & activate new creators and builders
If we make these assets readily available for people to access in an engaging and easy manner, it could open up doors for new people to enter the ecosystem.

Those that need assets to build on Nouns in new or interesting ways but have no developer or animation experience can often feel discouraged not knowing where to start.

With the Build-A-Noun app as a building block, we can inspire existing Nounish community members as well as potential new ones to create something Nounish easily and quickly. Anyone can get up and running with tens, hundreds, or thousands of animations ready to use within minutes.


## Deliverables
---
* Create an easy-to-use front-end tool + website where anyone can create and download unique cc0 gifs for any Noun configuration on the spot. The 20 unique states/actions are:
    * Idle (breathing + blinking)
    * Happy/Loved
    * Sad/Crying
    * Laughing
    * Talking
    * Sleeping
    * Dancing/Head bob
    * Eating
        * pizza
        * mushroom
        * fruit
        * veggies
        * hamburger
    * Drinking
        * coffee
        * water
        * tea
        * health potion
        * mana potion
    * Playing a gameboy
    * Tired
    * Sick
* Create a back-end API, where anyone can instantly grab any animation for any Noun configuration for use in their web apps programmatically via an API key and/or a URL
* Revamped front-end design with mobile-friendly version to generate animations on the go!
* Integration with our existing free-to-play side-app where users can interact and play with their Nouns (already built)
* Publicly host the raw base64 encoded png frame data for all Nouns assets in json format so anyone can use the animation frames how they like

## Timeline
---
### Total: 10 weeks

Each individual trait needs to be manually animated for all 20 states. That's roughly ~1,000 files per week (435 x 20 / 8). Some take shorter than others because they're static in a given animation, or they mimic the same motion as another animation and can be ported. Regardless, there is a lot of upfront work to be done.

### Weeks 1-4:
Front-end work, complete site redesign and development. Mobile-friendly optimization. Developing gif creation software with various customization options.

~50% of animations files complete

### Weeks 5-8:
Back-end work on API creation. Work on image processing and manipulating animation frame data. Create hosting solution for animation data.

~100% of animation files complete

### Weeks 9 & 10:
Hook-up back-end to front-end. Allow 2 week buffer for testing & bug fixes, or any last minute optimizations/improvements.

## Current Success Metrics (as of Oct '22)
---
As for our interactive app, CrypToadz holders seem to really enjoy it. Here’s a few metrics that show it’s stickiness. Note that no capital or time has been spent on marketing or advertising up to this point.

Retention Rates:
Day 1 Retention: 25% (Industry average)
Day 7 Retention: 15% (Industry average)
Day 30 Retention: 9% (Above industry average)

Active Users:
Daily Active Users / Monthly Active Users = 28% (Above industry average)


## Proposed Funding
---
55E for **Deliverables** within **Timeline** (10 weeks)
(immediately converted to USDC to avoid volatility)

*    60% Development of front-end Build-A-Noun app + back-end API tool
      * Complete website redesign/development & deployments
      * Mobile-friendly optimizations
      * Gif creation software development with various customization options
      * API endpoint creation
      * Software development for image processing/manipulation
      * Create hosting solution for animation frame data

     * Script development on animation automation and converting animations to workable json data

At the proposed cost, it works out to around <$8 per animation file, and $.00015 (not a typo, 1/100th of 1 penny) per possible animation using this tool.

## Testimonials
---
A lot of people have mentioned how much they loved their toad animations and seeing them in action, some even buying their first toad because of the interactive app! I think it’d be fun to provide this same experience for the Nouns community.

*""This sounds like a very fun idea, I love the animations.""*
-devcarrot, Nounder

*“Big fan of Toadzgotchi personally; Love what you're building.”*
-HEEEEEEEEEEE, CrypToadz founding team

+many more AMAZING supporters who couldn't fit on the page! THANK YOU!

## Future

In the future, we'd like to add more animations and more Nounish subcommunities (Lils, Gnars, etc), plus explore the idea of letting anyone upload their own animations to the builder in a review style process. This way, we can accrue an expansive database of assets to be used by all as the go-to solution for Nounish animations!

## Thank You

I sincerely appreciate everyone who spent time reading this. I am excited and eager to help contribute to the future of Nounish animations together! If you'd like to reach out for questions or comments, please do so - I'd be happy to chat!

188,Creator Contests - a Nounish Funding Middleware,"# Creator Contests - a Nounish Funding Middleware

## Tldr
Fund the Calabara team with 60 ETH to continue developing Creator Contests for a 3-month sprint.

## Introduction
Hi NounsDAO, we’re nick and weez, the tandem behind Calabara and Creator Contests. 

### Our Nounish Journey: part 1

Both of us were introduced to Nouns by way of SharkDAO, which we first joined over a year ago. We were fascinated by the Nouns protocol and community and soon began building out sharkish tools to ease some of the unique challenges of a Nounish subDAO. We created a dashboard for SharkDAO, which included widgets for a snapshot client, calendar, and token-gated document center. We wanted to build a simple interface for casual members to be able to quickly catch up on the latest in SharkDAO and Nouns. Soon after, other communities asked if they could have their own dashboards. We open-sourced the code, modularized the components, and invited other web3 groups to join. Today, we’d describe [Calabara](https://calabara.com/explore) as an open-source design house for public infrastructure and applications.

![](https://i.imgur.com/V819CqQ.png)


By prop [62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62), we began to get excited about many of the ideas being communicated by the Prop House team. We'd been thinking deeply about community funding protocols for some time ourselves, and were eager to experiment with the Prop House model. Unfortunately, we weren’t yet able to run our own Prop House rounds at SharkDAO (because we don’t use an erc721 for governance). Prop House wasn’t open-source yet, so we decided to fork the core ideas of Prop House and build something of our own: Creator Contests. 

## Creator Contests … WTF?

Creator Contests are a nounish middleware for distributing funds to creatives.

Creating scalable funding infrastructure at all levels is a critical building block in establishing Nouns as the world's largest open-source brand. Creator contests build upon the strong foundations developed by the Prop House team while experimenting with novel features to create unique incentive systems and new ways to fund builders – allowing any Nounish community with an ENS the ability to start running their own contests.

## How does it work?

Similar to Prop House, participants create submissions in response to a contest prompt, and voters choose the best ones. Once the contest is over, funds are distributed to the winners. All contests follow this basic model, but administrators have full control over the contest settings to layer-on additional components. Here’s what we offer today …

* Submitter Rewards
    * Define 1 or more winning ranks (1st, 2nd, ... nth place)
    * Define 1 or more rewards for listed ranks (ETH, ERC20, ERC721)
![](https://i.imgur.com/LK2Vg12.png)

* Voter Rewards
    * Voters that accurately choose rank N submission will split X reward.
    * Can be used to create unique incentive systems.
    * NOMO-style games can be created, where voters join forces to try to choose the 2nd best submisison without pushing it to first place.
![](https://i.imgur.com/IBwqCwI.png)

* Participant Restrictions
    * Token thresholds required for participants to submit or vote
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/YcwFxhK.png)

* Voting Strategies
    * Token -- Voting power based on token holdings
    * Arcade -- Uniform voting power for all qualifying voters
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/KpVyBT8.png)

* Twitter Integration
    * Collect submissions via Twitter interactions
    * Inherit all existing infrastructure while proliferating via Twitter
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/0J7OkhJ.png)
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/cDWuZ26.gif)
    
* Additional Parameters
    * Vote total visibility
    * Anonymous Submissions
    * Self Voting
  ![](https://i.imgur.com/jkCGMtY.png)


## Our Nounish Journey: part 2

Before Spring 2022, we had bootstrapped the project ourselves. We were lucky enough to receive support from SharkDAO, and they funded us with 7 ETH to develop an MVP of Creator Contests. We launched our first contest in September, and have helped fund 45 nounish creatives with ~4 ETH and 25k ERC-20 tokens since. 2 months ago, we received a small grant of 8 ETH from NSFW to develop the Twitter Integration mentioned above. We have groups like SharkDAO, Composables, TNS, and the Society of Nounish Cartoonists running contests as we speak. We are now ready to take Creator Contests to the next level.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Fk7grjB.png)


## Goals for the funding period

For this funding period, we’d like to focus on “Top of the funnel” funding infrastructure. This means implementing a scalable protocol for funding creatives in the 0.069 - 3 ETH range. Our goal is to fund 100+ nounish creatives in the 3-month window.

While bringing the codebase out of “MVP mode” so it can sufficiently scale to other Nounish pods (and make it easier to fork), we’ll work on the following upgrades:

* Support native video and other media formats
* Add vote audit reports
* Add voting capability for Noun delegates
* Experiment with new voting strategies
* Simplify contest initialization process.
* Improve our twitter algorithms
* UX redesign - It’s time for CC to get Nounish


We’d also like to answer the following questions:

* Are voter rewards a feature or a bug?
* In the voting period, how impactful are visible vote totals on a communities ability to choose the “best” submissions?
* Does submission history serve as a relevant talent repository for other pods?
* Are deep Twitter integrations viable for other tasks, like governance? (Nouncil, Nerman, etc)
* Are there ways to maintain a certain level of submission quality without directly moderating submissions?
    * Prop House already sees a certain percentage of “low quality” submissions, and we’ll see higher levels at this funding tier. Are there ways to ensure a certain quality standard without direct moderation? Learnings from this experimentation could be layered on top of Prop House and other applications.







## Defining success

Success at the funding tier we are targeting is tightly coupled with onboarding. We’ll define onboarding for the scope of this project as the following:

* New creatives
    * Introduce new creatives to Nouns and extension communities
* Existing creatives to larger funding tiers
    * Support creatives in the earliest stages of ideation that can translate to quality Prop House or NSFW proposals
* Between Nounish extension communities
    * Increase the discoverability factor of extension projects and communities through different contest designs and synergies, i.e.
        * TNS and Composables co-host a round
        * Multi-community voting
        * Twitter contests

Of course, success for us also hinders on our ability to proliferate the meme. Twitter integrations drastically increase our proliferation potential -- elevating contests from a siloed web app to a publicly discoverable and interactable experience. We're focused on lifting the stack as close to the ""public edge"" as possible and see the potential for these integrations in other Nounish areas.  

Defining success is one thing, measuring it is different. For this funding term, we’ll do so manually by following up with participants and winners while exploring ways we can automate and better measure this in the future.


## Prop House

*Why not just fork Prop House for real?*

While we haven’t really heard this much, it’s a valid question that we anticipate some Nouners might have.

Halting further experimentation to go back and layer our changes on top of the PH codebase feels like a step backwards at this point in time. We envision a coordinated approach where both PH and CC are able to sandbox and test different ideas and merge the ones that work. Ultimately, the far more relevant component to fork will be the smart contracts for a trustless implementation that the PH team is leading, which we fully plan on doing. 

At worst, CC is an alternative client for Prop House. At best, it is an experiment in funding infrastructure, working alongside Prop House in developing sound protocols for high velocity, trustless, and scalable funding infrastructure for web3 communities – all powered by Nouns.

Let's scale the provision of extremely nounish public goods through culturally relevant activations. Ultimately empowering action sportspeople to uplift their communities with the first ""never-ending [expression session](https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/the-history-of-the-expression-session-in-surfing).""

*ie. Our subculture's rendition of the [nouns virtuous cycle](https://medium.com/@punk4156/the-nouns-virtuous-cycle-95586bb9c7c9).*

## 🤘 Gnars is Extremely nounish

[Gnars](https://gnars.com) is an extension ([fork](https://gnars.wtf)) of Nouns dedicated to supporting the artistry of extreme athletes. We've [sponsored over a dozen](https://gnars.com/riders) skateboarders, snowboarders, surfers, scooter riders, inline skaters, roller skaters, skiers and an entire motorcycle club.

[![](https://i.imgur.com/0DCX8jK.jpg)](https://twitter.com/nounish/status/1569692294529581056)

[Since receiving 69 ETH to get started](https://nouns.wtf/vote/51) just 7 months ago, we've attracted millions of views on our nounish content, caught the attention of industry icons such as [Bob Burnquist](https://www.instagram.com/bobburnquist/) and have been onboarding people in *extremely nounish ways, like these 1.5M views with [Tom Rohrer](https://www.instagram.com/toms_tutorials/):*

![](https://i.imgur.com/QkY1C9e.jpg)

Most recently we've been making a splash in Brazil thanks to our involvement with I LOVE XV, an annual skateboarding event in its 10th year. With [a budget of just 6 ETH](https://gnars.house/proposals/0xb63306dbfe950dd9754d5edcf8f48c6ff9bdd32eeeff4c644cb90c974a3055fa) those involved brought together 1000+ skaters in Rio de Janeiro to shred the biggest noggles ever made:

[![](https://i.imgur.com/656PzQ6.jpg)](https://twitter.com/nounish/status/1593765220425486337)

Not only did they produce terabytes of incredible content, our Brazilian crew provided the inspiration for this proposal. We learned that instead of just sponsoring individuals, we should empower them to uplift their communities as a whole:

![](https://i.imgur.com/JLwvCJb.jpg)

Now we're an internet collective of over 750 members ready to actualise our subculture's rendition of the ""nouns virtuous cycle."" We will establish the first ""never-ending [expression session](https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/the-history-of-the-expression-session-in-surfing)"" to power our CC0 media machine.

Packing everything we've done into a 90 second video is near impossible, so we hope what made the cut serves as a memento for those who collect it. Many thanks to [4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1600505145397317634) and [Jacob](https://jacob.energy/predicting-provenance.html) who inspired our making of this compilation and its subsequent minting. Shoutout [Kai](https://twitter.com/m3thaverse), [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye) and [Trizzy](https://twitter.com/trizzytrunk) for pulling everything together at short notice.

## 🤔 What'll 694.20 ETH look like?

Brazil taught us that cultural relevance is incredibly important. For example, the giant noggles you've seen people skating are permanently installed in Rio de Janeiro at Praça XV, alongside other iconic urban sculptures installed each year by Coletivo XV.

![](https://i.imgur.com/uOAnnqd.png)

Our giant noggles are in the same town square as the giant skateboard, one of the most photographed landmarks in Rio, third only to Christ the Redeemer and Sugar Loaf which are both globally recognisable.

[![](https://i.imgur.com/H5xaVey.png)](https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1598537522141069312)

The ability to do more activations like what we've seen in Brazil depends on the roll-out of the greatest onboarding effort Nouns has ever seen. Let's explore some of the ways we plan on scaling:

### Builder onboarding via seasonal Prop House rounds

Gnars DAO has attracted builders who've paved the way with their creative approaches to activating their communities. Many hail from emerging markets where we can have an outsized impact and their values are already closely aligned with ours as crypto natives.

![](https://i.imgur.com/uYMx45z.png)

[Prop House](https://prop.house) allows us to run mandated funding rounds each season that will see builders competing for the opportunity to uplift their respective communities. Each round will fund activations as described below and we've already received expressions of interest from suitable candidates throughout South America, Africa, Asia and more.

### Public goods delivery through builder-led activations

Builders funded each round will be equipped with everything they need for public goods delivery through thoughtful and culturally relevant activations. Leaning on our experience in Brazil, we'll help motivated individuals become local heroes.

![](https://i.imgur.com/56iuFKh.gif)

Our community will help them to implement nounish obstacles, crypto wallets and NFTs (10% of Gnars are for onboarding), merch and stickers, photo walls and banners, and to receive delivery of remuneration, Noun 189 skateboards and various types of noggles.

### Hashtag campaigns to catalyse social media curation

We're not looking for ""[flash in the pan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flash_in_the_pan)"" type events and are committed to the pursuit of the ""[nouns virtuous cycle](https://medium.com/@punk4156/the-nouns-virtuous-cycle-95586bb9c7c9)."" We will leverage hashtags like **#ThatsGnarly** across all platforms to launch ongoing crowd-sourced social media campaigns.

![](https://i.imgur.com/B82OcJz.jpg)

Such a rudimentary approach removes all barriers to entry so that the first step in joining the movement is simply posting to a hashtag. We can meet newcomers where they already express themselves, curate the best content based on impact and prepare creators for [a Web3 revolution](https://thatsgnar.ly).

### Creator onboarding to the Gnars Revolution protocol

[Revolution](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution) is a protocol from [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.xyz) (and [gnars.house](https://gnars.house/)) designed to enable the earning of governance rights through contributions other than capital. We are working closely with the team to give Gnars holders a reddit-like curatorial experience for content submitted to #ThatsGnarly.

![](https://i.imgur.com/wCsJkxJ.jpg)

Content surfaces on a Web3 leaderboard at [thatsgnar.ly](https://thatsgnar.ly) after being submitted by extreme sports creators across social media. Competing in the ""gnarketplace"" for attention, top performing content is minted and sold as NBA Topshot style NFTs in daily auctions – *ie. Prop House for tricks.*

![](https://i.imgur.com/fxNEx13.jpg)

*Trick NFTs released under CC0, Gnars NFTs drawn from 10% of supply already allocated to athlete/artist onboarding and each GNAR is equal to one Gnars DAO governance vote.*

## 🚀 How we'll spend 694.20 ETH

We're a passionate community with domain expertise who know very well the agility required to succeed. Our plans are subject to change and funds will be disbursed through our own proven governance, but this should give you some idea of what to expect:

### Activations

Skateboard production and shipping, existing skate park refurbishments, localised merchandise production, Nouns Vision and Bigshot noggles, fabrication of more giant noggles and so much more.

![](https://i.imgur.com/XQ5qksI.jpg)

*Additional locations where sculpture installation is not allowed will be activated using NFC enabled ""⌐◨-◨"" beacons that prompt visitors to get involved.* 

![](https://i.imgur.com/2OGWJ1z.jpg)

*This is a rough mockup of small indestructible noggle fixtures that can be glued discreetly at existing spots without degrading an obstacle's user experience.*

### Autonomy

Since inception, our community have had access to Noun 189 in order to participate in Nouns DAO governance. The time has come for Gnars DAO to acquire two Nouns of their own. Enough funds to purchase 2 Nouns will be allocated to auction bidding.

![](https://i.imgur.com/vD0S5Ty.gif)

Additional funds from our ongoing NFT auctions will bolster this funding request, further efforts laid out in this proposal, and allow us to continue onboarding professional team riders who represent us throughout their respective industries as ambassadors.

## 🛹 We're built for onboarding

[I recently asked nouns twitter](https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1596051642725830656), ""what is the biggest problem with nouns dao that needs solving?"" I was delighted to receive a response [from 4156 directly](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1596061577794330624): 

> ""same as every other crypto token imo: distribution. how to onboard maximum number of high quality, aligned etc. participants into the network""

Onboarding is something we take seriously at Gnars and we are uniquely positioned to onboard the next million [proliferatooooors](https://create.zora.co/collections/0x8c5effc5fb5d3805212713115427f4efe82a40be) by staying ""extremely nounish"" and applying the true grit and perseverance we've learned through our commitment to action sports culture.

Following the overwhelmingly positive response to the Nouns Explainer created by **Ordinary Folk from [Prop 113](https://nouns.wtf/vote/113)**, we are proposing that Nouns releases this video as a timed open edition.

This is a groundbreaking proposal, as it will be the first time that Nouns DAO will be minting and releasing a creative work that was commissioned by the DAO.

By minting this video from the DAO via a proposal, it is becoming NounsDAO canon. Similar to how the DAO added in [new head attributes](https://nouns.wtf/vote/125) via a proposal, Nouns can continue to explore and experiment with new models of CC0 art and production and minting directly from the DAO is a new tool for the organization to directly release and distribute the most important artifacts from the community. It’s not hard to see how this can advance Nouns into a crypto-native form of Movie Studio, Production House, Art Museum and so on.

This video will be released as a Timed Open Edition for a price of 0.05 ETH. This means it will be available for anyone to mint for the specified minting period, which will be open until the Rose Parade on January 2nd, 2023. The proceeds from sale will be split between Nouns (60%) and Ordinary Folk (40%).

We are excited to experiment with DAO NFT releases as an additional value capture mechanism, and potentially create a simple and repeatable model for any creator, community and brand in the ecosystem to put forward amazing artifacts to be minted via Nouns.

This edition will be minted with [Zora](https://zora.co), and will be available to mint onchain and at [thisisnouns.wtf](https://thisisnouns.wtf)

### What is Mucho Love?


**Mucho Love is a social impact platform that follows a “see good, do good” format.**  
ML uses social impact activations and content creation/distribution to proliferate ⌐◧-◧ .

**It began in Lil Nouns on prop.house** ([https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-3/655](https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-3/655)) **and then went on-chain**. ([https://nouns.wtf/vote/137](https://nouns.wtf/vote/137)).

#### In the past 6 months, we have:

### Problem Statement

Charitable efforts, social impact, and public goods are **cornerstone activities within the Nouns ecosystem**.

NounsDAO **has funded a total of 1468 ETH for 19 proposals** related to charitable efforts/social impact through on-chain, NSFW, and prop.house. *_Data from proposal.wtf_

Public goods are an **essential** part of what Nouns is, not only helping society but making the community feel even more connected with each other. **The desire to help others and make a positive impact on the world**, for many people, is **a way to connect with others and create a sense of community and shared purpose**.

**What are the main problems?**
-   Nouns has yet to have a platform that leverages all of these impacts done by the community, content creation opportunities are not seized.
-   As Nouns keeps growing and more public goods are activated, the need for a flexible framework that produces raw content of charitable efforts, public goods, and donations is a must within the ecosystem.
-   There should be a platform that gathers community members interested in social impact and public goods.

**Social Impact is one of the best ways to show any human what Nouns can do**. The power that **see good, do good** content has is too big to let it go to waste. So far, Nouns has been one of the most successful projects at integrating IRL to web3 impact.

Showing everyone how a community can come together to help others and cooperate with each other, **a community connected by ⌐◨-◨**, is an excellent way to noun-pill newcomers.

This is where _**Nouns Love**_ comes in.

![nounslove](https://i.imgur.com/Zo86psu.png)

### What is Nouns Love?
Nouns Love is born from the interest of the Mucho Love’s team to **develop a global platform that uses content from social impact, public goods, charitable efforts to leverage the expansion of Nouns through social media content creation and storytelling**. Nouns Love will focus on in-real-life impact activations and public goods generated by the Nounish community.

The power that **see good, do good** content has is too big to let it go to waste. So far, Nouns has been one of the most successful projects at integrating IRL to web3 impact.

**Nouns Love will increase brand equity by building a positive association with the brand in a widespread audience**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/4lw5YK7.jpg)

### Transitioning to _Nouns Love_
We will start transitioning from Mucho Love to Nouns Love. Mucho Love will stay as a branch of Nouns Love for further social impact experimentation, public interaction, and testing ground of new ideas in the DR.

**Nouns Love** aims to become a branch of Nouns that focuses on using storytelling, different narratives, and high-quality IRL content creation, which with the **see good, do good** content format **will expand Nouns to a global audience**.

By the end of the 4-month extension Nouns Love aims to be established as a fully functional platform.

![](https://i.imgur.com/5j9RvTb.jpg)

### Mucho Love and international communities
International communities will be using the model created by Mucho Love for its activations to test its adaptability. This will allow to take into account the inherent differences between countries, cultures, societal structures that exist throughout the world.

**The communities that will test the model**:  
◨ Uganda - led by Davin ([https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye))  
◨ Mexico - led by Mono & Ale ([https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos))  
◨ Germany - led by bk ([https://twitter.com/0xbk_](https://twitter.com/0xbk_))  
◨ Spain - led by BlakeNeit ([https://twitter.com/blakeneit](https://twitter.com/blakeneit))

**DR activations**:
-   Knife RD x Mucho Love - “We cooked 100 children’s dream meals” ([https://www.instagram.com/kniferd/](https://www.instagram.com/kniferd/))
-   Giving an entire community free hair cuts and essentials
-   @sunsetco.rd x Mucho Love - “We took 10 families to see the beach for the first time” ([https://www.instagram.com/sunsetco.rd/](https://www.instagram.com/sunsetco.rd/))
-   Techo RD x Mucho Love - [https://rd.techo.org/](https://rd.techo.org/) - Building a house for a family that lost it all to Hurricane Fiona
-   Hugo Mendoza Children’s Hospital x Mucho Love ([https://hospitalhugomendoza.gob.do/](https://hospitalhugomendoza.gob.do/))

**International activations**:
-   A refugee dedicated to preserving the endangered Mexican donkey
-   A volunteering event that will hand out food to homeless people around the city.
-   A child care center for orphans and abandoned children to donate clothes, nounish educational materials such as books and pencils, toys, and dry stock food hampers.
-   A city clean-up activation volunteering event.

### Content creation and distribution
**Every public good, social impact, and charitable effort has a unique narrative**. Through storytelling, all of these narrative can portray what it means to be nounish. Nouns Love will have its own in-house marketing team **to develop unique narratives through captivating, “see good, do good” style videos**.

**The amount of raw content that can be produced from public goods, charitable efforts, social impact is immense**. The marketing team will receive raw content to produce high-quality content for social media distribution. The team will have constant brainstorming sessions with international community leads to deeply understand the particular narratives of every activation done.

Content creation was one of the biggest challenges that Mucho Love faced, not having our own team that could develop our ideas, concepts, and styles was a huge limiting factor on our social media content capacity. **NL’s in-house team will allow us to 5x our content creation capabilities**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZjHKKHM.jpg)

### Development of a flexible framework
During the past 6 months of activations, Mucho Love has made mistakes, created solutions, and changed formats. The amount of time lost by Mucho Love’s starting inefficiencies is very significant. Time-efficiency is the reason why we decided to develop a flexible framework for public goods, charitable efforts, and social impact.

**A flexible framework that allows for better, smoother activations, therefore saving time.** The framework will take into account many minor details that may be overlooked which can lead to a poor activation and overall experience.

**This framework will be tested by our international communities** that will be performing social impact activations during the following 4 months.

![](https://i.imgur.com/UvXE2KN.png)

### Global synchronous activations
**A global synchronous activation is an activity performed by many different communities that form the Nounish ecosystem in a certain time period**. These activations will target the same issue/activity and produce raw content for content creation.

By providing a platform for people to connect and interact in real time, global synchronous activities **can help to build relationships and foster a sense of belonging among members of a community**.

**Nouns Love aims to portray the amazing work being done by nounish communities all around the world**. With storytelling, content creation, narratives, and marketing allowing Nouns to reach a wide audience.

By removing all barriers of crypto, web3, creating a wallet, discord, different websites, twitter, **see good, do good content** will be able to transcend as far as many hearts it touches in its path. Additionally, global synchronous activities will help build momentum and enthusiasm for a particular cause or issue, driving up engagement and participation within the community.

### Social media & content distribution
**We aim to expand Nouns Love to**:  
◨ Youtube: Mid-length video format striving to combine storytelling with good animations, edits, and clips that will lead to the production of family-friendly, shareable, “see good, do good.” content.  
◨ Tiktok: Short video formats with catchy hooks with the main point of spreading the ⌐◧-◧s through the platform. Making it easier for people who find the ⌐◧-◧s interesting to click the profile and access other social media where more information will be more easily found (Instagram, Youtube).  
◨ Instagram: So far, Instagram has worked for us pretty well. A few flops and one fantastic post (a post with 67,000 likes), but it’s been great in general. Instagram will be the “face” of what NL stands for, does, and activates. We’ll also be using challenge formats to engage more people.  
◨ Twitter: We’ll be using Twitter to make updates like “Today, Nouns Love donated 100 football kits powered by ⌐◧-◧”.

**Combining youtube’s storytelling capabilities through mid-length content that engages viewers, TikTok’s short-form video with hooks that captivate the attention to the noggles, and Instagram as the face of NL, we believe that it’ll be only a matter of time & effort for us to reach substantially good levels in all these platforms**.

194,Increase Voting Delay to 5 Days,"# Increase Voting Delay to 5 Days

A proposal, when submitted to Nouns DAO, has to go through the following:

 - 2 days of Voting Delay
 - 5 days of Voting Period

This configuration was last updated in [Prop 161](https://nouns.wtf/vote/161).

I propose we increase the voting delay to 5 days for the following reasons:

 - Gives the public more time to view, evaluate, and discuss props in public before big votes come in and sway opinions.
 - Gaurantees that weekly meetings will be able to discuss every prop no matter when it was submitted.
 - Gives DAOs and Communities with Nouns more time to organize the logistics of posting the props for discussion, holding an internal vote on it, and processing the vote on-chain.

# Atrium X Nouns - A Lore Experiment
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZQDdQuJ.jpg)

## Description:
**TL,DR**
We are proposing to commission [Atrium](https://atrium.art/) & [3D Print Guy](https://twitter.com/3d_printguy) to create a cinematic 1:30-2min animated story introducing the World of Nouns. Bring the expertise of a Pixar veteran to the Nouns ecosystem enabling us to create a foundational animated short story & proliferate the meme!


[Check out the proposal trailer!](https://twitter.com/3D_PrintGuy/status/1604906537184792576)
![](https://i.imgur.com/V58xsIR.jpg)

**Wait, what is Atrium?**
Atrium.art is a crypto-native network of independent artists and creators. Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting, Animation, Concept Art, Voice Actors, and Music production. Together, creatives on Atrium bring experience from Pixar, Marvel, Luma Pictures, Sony, Netflix and many more.

> You can see the work of Artists on Atrium [here](https://atrium.art/)

Simply put, Atrium is a way to easily piece together veteran talent to produce cinematic content.

**So … What is this animated Lore?**
Nouns are cc0 identities coming forth one day at a time. While there have been explainer videos done via [113](https://nouns.wtf/vote/113) and open video content proposals (explainers) via [181](https://nouns.wtf/vote/181), We want to create an engaging cinematic introduction to the world of nouns. One that reflects the original intent behind the emergence of Nouns DAO, a story that shows who nouns are, what they have been up to, and a nod to future plans. A tale that leaves the audience curious, engaged, and wanting for more.

We believe this animation will serve as a foundation to build an expansive storyworld on top of nouns cc0 IP. Where any noun could go beyond the core nouns audience and have a viewership across different communities native to crypto and beyond.

**Who is the creator behind this first story?**
Having a creator who understands the NFT space, the broader story, and cinematic culture is important when developing content to serve as a landing page for Nouns. We believe that 3D Print Guy is uniquely equipped in style, storytelling and understanding to provide a memorable rendition of the values and beliefs behind nouns.
![](https://i.imgur.com/rmzvlQT.jpg)

With over 2 decades of experience in the business, including working on films like Up, he has been tugging on your heart strings over many years. His youtube page has content eclipsing 45 million views and his characters and plots have shown the ability to capture the world’s attention. He has also demonstrated an ability to release relevant content based on trending topics as seen with his most recent animation about [ChatGPT](https://twitter.com/3D_PrintGuy/status/1600116597711990784) (5k+ likes, 77k+ video views on twitter).

Quick Links about 3D Print Guy -

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/3D_PrintGuy)

In 2022 alone he has produced 15 min of animation both in longer formats and short viral clips, with sound design and VFX all done in house. In 2023, we hope to have the opportunity to help proliferate the nouns as well.

**Process at Atrium**
The entire process is a feedback loop. We would be creating a special channel on the Atrium discord server where Nouners are welcome to join and follow along the milestones of the process.

We would love to have at least one nounder to engage in conversation so that the story stays loosely true to the canon if any.

* The workflow starts with defining the script and dialogs (if any) for the story. This involves defining shot by shot verbatim descriptions of what is happening on screen. A good story is a great script in the first step.
* After the script is done, we start to look for Voice actors who will help narrate / engage in dialog based on the script. If the script doesn’t have any dialogs and is mostly visually expressive we skip this step.
* Now the fun part begins where you start to model the characters, the environment, the objects in the scene. Rigging a model is technically intensive process and better rigged models are more equipped for better emotions during a scene (more fluid and organic movements)

![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/e/e4408f0a1790f89fa248ea6aa9d233881580b665_2_522x518.jpeg)
* Once you have the 3d assets ready - you start the process of Look-Dev. Look development in CG means you start to give definition to the model through textures, lighting, colours etc. They start to come to life.
* Animatic essentially lets you block out part by part of the story sequence with actual scene setup (the animation is not smooth and done yet but essentially simulates the storyboard).
* Using the animatic, Sound design can start to happen.
* We will review the animatic and invite feedback to the animatic via our communication channel.
* Once the animatic is locked down, the final animation work begins. This is the most intensive and time consuming process and takes the bulk of the later half of the creation cycle.
* After final animation is done - it is time for last visual effects, lighting passes, refinements before you start to map out the finished sound design artefacts as well as the dialogs.
* And then the final Reveal of the output (examples shared above). Final Output to premiere both on Twitter as well as youtube.

We will be utilising the Story’s reach in terms of reshares / likes / social engagement as metrics for success.

**Ask / Cost**

All inclusive production cost is proposed to be 20 ETH. (Transferred to the Atrium Multi-sig upon execution)

Things covered included

* Storyboarding, Scripting
* Multiple character plotline (3d Modelling)
* In 3d animation, cost ramps up as you animate more than one character in a scene + dialog work
* Voice Over + Sound design
* Animation
* Final FX

> We will also be including the main characters 3d files (rigged) available for download and re-use under cc0.


**Production Schedule**
Post the proposal execution, we will look at a final production duration of about 6-8 weeks of the above process.


We will be coordinating the comms and logistics through out the whole process alongside 3dPrintGuy. Below are the team members involved:

**The Future**

After the first nouns story, based on the reception of the content launch and social signals, Atrium intends to come back with a larger proposal to fund n (undecided number) number of new original nouns Stories.

This will be Atrium’s take on creating an expanding anthology series centered around nounish lore where different creators from the Atrium ecosystem come together to build new characters with their backstories, lore and more.

This will be an interactive exercise where we will do a Casting call and participating creators / artists themselves make the decision on selecting casting call winners.",EXECUTED,16241591,16277591,1,55,,1000000,1000,1500,550,215,0,0,['20000000000000000000'],['0x58947f539f1c1e930c2aea6e8a9fb0ecc9763357'],[''],16227191,1671554771,0xf224449b8c273bba2cdd062626ca87504ef0ef7ad426e92295bd66e6e65ec150,['0x'],0x5606b493c51316a9e65c9b2a00bbf7ff92515a3e

# **TLDR;**

This proposal aims to develop Nouns Sports Pick’Em™ - an inclusive community-based game that proliferates Nouns through the global sports community. 

**Proliferating the Nouns & Benefitting the Community:**

1)	**Make sports communities and fan-engagement Nounish**

2)	**Educate and grow a community of Nouners within Web2 sports fans**

3)	**Create a fun place for Nouners to enjoy sports together**

![](https://i.imgur.com/HuKu41u.jpg)


# **How It Works:**

Noun Sports Pick’Em™ is a peer-to-peer platform that hosts contests where players pick which teams they think will win, earn points for correct selections, and win prizes! This global game is NOT gambling. It’s a peer-to-peer platform where fans challenge each other to test their sports knowledge. It’s where trivia meets March Madness, but for every sport and every Nouner. Nouners will participate against each other in fun, easy, and simple-to-play daily contests across all major sports leagues. Here’s how to play:
 
### Players join and get a free game credit. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/Je5UNvw.png)
### Contesting will be available in major global sports leagues, with new leagues being added on demand.
![](https://i.imgur.com/LuODrnj.png)
### Players choose a contest of their choice

### The more points they earn the higher the prize

# Proliferating The Nouns
Sports is a global passion, integrated within every Web2 and Web3 community. However, the bridge between these two groups has always been a challenge. When it comes to understanding Web3, Web2 users simply don’t know where to start. It’s up to Web3 projects to create resources that are immediately useful to them; Noun Sports Pick’Em™ is designed to do exactly that. This game cultivates an audience of Web2 sports fans in one place by providing a fun, inclusive, daily sports game.

Once the user has been registered, the game is designed to develop their interest in Web3, specifically the Nouns. In addition to the game’s Nouns branding, there are several key user journeys that will proliferate the Nouns.
1.	**NFT Prizes:** Many of the prizes will be NFTs and the dollar values will be shown. When Web2 users see the monetary value tied to the asset, they will be far more inclined to learn about NFTs. ***We will prioritize prizing from the Nouniverse ecosystem***
2.	**Nouns Updates:** Users will receive regular updates through e-mail and push notifications about other Nouns projects. There will be a page on the App where they can learn more about these projects.
3.	**Daily Facts:** Everyday there will be a brief Noun fact pop-up that users will see when they first open the App. Users can click “Explore Nouns” to be redirected to the Nouns Encyclopedia. 
4.	**Weekly Voting:** Every week, users can vote on which prize they want the following week. Showing the various NFT utility (many of which will be sports related) will educate users on the Web3 space. On this page, users can click to learn more about the Nouns DAO and voting as well.
5.	**Nouns Encyclopedia:** Across the App there will be prompts for users to click “Nouns Encyclopedia” which will be a complete guide to the Nouns. Users will be provided with direct links the Nouns native site

### A subsection of the app titled “Nouns Encyclopedia” will be a resource centre for players to learn about Nouns and NFT’s 
![](https://i.imgur.com/F7D7VjC.png)
### In app messaging will provide players with interesting facts about the Nouns, Nouns DAO, and NFT’s 
![](https://i.imgur.com/7udQWRo.png)
### Players will be notified on the app when a new Noun has been minted and provided with a redirect to the Nouns website to bid on future Nouns 
![](https://i.imgur.com/Stky4Ov.png)
### Bounty will offer NFTs as contest grand prizes, and players will have the ability to vote on which NFT prize they’d like to play for

# **Marketing & Continuation Plan**


Noun Sports Pick’Em™ will proliferate the Nouns and captivate a Web2 sports audience through a multitude of marketing channels. Diversity in strategy ensures the diversity of the audience and maximum reach of the Nouns community. The marketing budget was determined so that Noun Sports Pick’Em™ can acquire 10,000 users in its first year and reach a total audience of over 57,000,000 sports fans globally. The campaigns will also include several Web3 influencers, events, and channels to acquire sports fans within the Web3 community as well. Marketing strategies include the following:

1.	**Influencers** (YouTube & Twitch)  - We will work with a vast network of YouTube / Twitch streamers (primarily e-sports and sporting news content creators) to promote Nouns Sports Pick’Em™ and migrate their audiences to the platform
2.	**Paid Media** – We will run targeted interactive media ads via ad publishing networks
3.	**Podcasts** – We will partner and become a staple on various sports centric and NFT-focused podcasts to grow the Nouns Sports Pick’Em™ brand reach and total impressions
4.	**Referral/Organic** – We will develop a robust referral program, where Nouners and new players can refer their networks to earn game credits, prizes, tickets, and more
5.	 **Conferences & Events** – We will be an active participant at various NFT and Sports conferences alike, to deliver on the ground promotion of Nouns Sports Pick’Em™


# **Monetization & Project Longevity**

Nouns Sports Pick’Em™ generates revenue by taking a 10% rake on paid contests, which allows the game to operate in perpetuity. Revenue generated will fund prizing and marketing in Year 2, and beyond. All excess funds will be used towards purchasing Nouns and other relevant sports NFTs, which will be layered in as additional prizes within the game. Bounty Sports is also committed to sponsoring other Nouners’ projects to grow our own game and re-invest in the Noun community. 



# **FAQ About Proposal**

**Q:** Is this sports betting?
**A:** No! This game format is considered a “game of skill”. There is no “house”, and all contests are run as peer-to-peer competitions. In essence, it’s a form of sports trivia. 

**Q:** Will Nouns Sports Pick’Em™ have e-sports?
**A:** Absolutely. E-sports will be significant focus for Nouns Sports Pick’Em™, understanding it’s one of the shared bridges between Web2 and Web3 communities.

**Q:** Is this a free-to-play (FTP) or pay-to-play (P2P) game?
**A:** Both. To be inclusive and ensure everyone can play, the F2P game will be available globally. We will also offer a P2P game for users that want to compete with their own currency to win cash prizes. 

**Q:** How is the game monetized?
**A:** The F2P game is not monetized, it’s FREE! The P2P game takes a 10% commission on the prize pool. For example: 100 users @ Ξ 0.10 = Ξ 9.00 prize pool + Ξ 1.00 commission to Nouns Sports Pick’Em™. The commissions will go towards funding future F2P prizes and marketing, so the game will run in perpetuity!


**Q:** Will the game accept crypto deposits & withdrawals?
**A:** Of course!


**Q:** Is this a Web2 game or a Web3 game?
**A:** This is a Web2 game. You don’t need a Noun or any other NFT to sign-up and play. The objective is to capture a widescale Web2 sports audience, as well as sports fans in Web3, and educate them on the Nouns.

**Q:** How do you build the Nouns name among Web2 users?
**A:** The Nouns Sports Pick’Em™ will be marketed to a Web2 audience through traditional marketing channels. Once on the platform, user engagement will be optimized to educate users. The game will leverage, giveaways, gamification, and regular communication to bring attention to the Nouns community.

**Q:** Will Bounty integrate its existing audience into the Noun Sports Pick’Em™?
**A:** Yes! Bounty has 20,000 active players. Through the F2P game, they’ll have opportunities to win prizes, and be directed to the Nouns ecosystem. 

**Q:** What will Luke Rockhold’s involvement be on this project?
**A:** Bounty has unlimited worldwide use of Luke’s name, image, and likeness. We will leave it to the Nouns community to decide if, when, and how they’d like to leverage this resource within the project.

### Why should Nouns fund a 3D-printed fashion collection?

*  3D-printed fashion is nascent and experimental. Not unlike Nouns, it's at the intersection of art, culture & tech. 
*  The tech being so new, and the visuals so striking, 3D-printed clothes and textiles get a lot of attention. The collection is eye-catching and different. It can be used to attract attention at various events. 
*  Fashion executives, especially in the innovation departments of big brands, are always on the lookout for the next thing. Through this collection nouns will stand out and help future potential brands learn about the opportunity to build on this open-source brand!
* It's also just very nounish: pushing the boundaries of fashion in an authentic way.
---

### What does this proposal include?

* Finish modeling and printing 5 looks.
* Attending NFT Paris with a custom-built exhibition space, in a magnificent historic location, the Grand Palais.

### Why combine finalizing the collection with the NFT Paris event? 
* Since it's physical, I want the collection to get exposure and eyeballs IRL. This event has the perfect audience and location. It is very fashion-oriented and is an NFT event.  


### Progress since my last proposal:

* Participated in the first [metaverse fashion week](https://twitter.com/danitpeleg3d/status/1508118881570897927) with the Nouns collection
* 90% finished Patternmaking, Modeling, and Rendering all the looks.
* Printed the first garment in Polyjet: the “king” dress and assembled it.
* Started making a special Nouns filament for printing with FDM tech.


### Progress on Roadmap:

1. ☑ **Research** - Inspiration board, material research, printing samples
2. ☑ **Design** - sketches
3. ☑ **Patternmaking/Rendering/Modeling** - 3D modeling the sketches into 3D-printable files
4. ☑ **Print Testing** - testing many different types of printers, configurations, materials etc
5. ☑ **Participate in Metaverse Fashion Week (MVFW)**
6. **STARTED: Printing finals** - printing the entire collection
7. **STARTED: Assembling** - using different techniques (e.g. gluing, knotting, etc) to assemble the collection together
8. **Photoshoot (with real-life models)** - for press materials, websites, AR filter etc
9. **NEW: Showcase collection at NFT Paris** - Invited & will have a booth and interactive AR display
10. **Marketing** - prepare press kit. The collection gets PR, is booked for events, and showcases galleries & museums

*Nouns Esports is submitting this proposal on behalf of [Slacks](https://twitter.com/SirActionSlacks) & [Kyle](https://twitter.com/keepingitkyle) from WePlay Esports.* 

### Hello NounsDAO!

We are Weplay, a globally recognized Esports event company who specialize in creating groundbreaking productions in the world of gaming. From weekly shows with the NFL and top Twitch Streamers, to multi-million dollar Esports events such as the (Emmy Nominated) Dota 2  Animajor, we pride ourselves on making the most memorable and exciting events in Esports. 

Now, it's time for Nouns to have one of their very own: THE NOUNSVITATIONAL! 

## Please watch our short VIDEO PROPOSAL BELOW! 



[![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pet9rHvlNs](https://i.imgur.com/IQh4GII.png) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhwg_nlX-w)

---

 
 Short and sweet: we believe that an Esports event can take Nouns to new heights. We don't want to just show people some Noggles and call it a day - We want to enact a 3 step mass integration program designed around introducing (and integrating) the esports public at large into Web3, Nouns communities, and furthering the Nouns mission.  
 
 
 
### Introduction 
 
 We first learned about Nouns after your fantastic Dota 2 team entered the scene, and we got to know a few of the amazing folks over at the Nouns Esports crew. After doing our research on Nouns, we were impressed to find a group of people who were different from the normal Dota 2 Esports sponsors. In a scene plagued by Betting Companies, Scam Coins, and other nefarious evil-doers, it was refreshing to find a group of people using Crypto in a positive way; One that we would be proud to partner with to spread their message. Weplay prides itself on being the best in our industry and working with the best in their industry, and we believe that this project would be one of those partnerships. 
 
![](https://i.imgur.com/wb1Bub0.jpg)

 
 ### What we Offer
 
 What Nouns Proposals have been doing so far is great, but we believe we can do so much more for the growth of Nouns in the eyes of the general public. Many of your successfully executed Proposals in the past have focused on getting the brand of Nouns out there with general advertising methods of simply ""showing the brand"". What we offer is not only brand recognition, but brand integration, on a wide and universal scale. 
 
We don't just want people to know what Noggles are. We want people to know about the Nouns mission, the point of a DAO, and to get people who have never heard of Crypto or NFT's (even people who actively dislike them) to see the Web3 world in a positive light by having them actively participate in a system designed around an event that we know they want to watch. 
 
![](https://i.imgur.com/Ay6mRjf.jpg)

 
  ### The 3 Step Plan 
  
  Our idea is simple: get viewers to come for the Dota, and stay for the Nouns.  ⌐◨-◨
  
1. ENTERTAIN

Creating a custom, interesting Dota Tournament structure with a dual purpose of getting as many viewers as possible to watch due to its innovative nature, world class teams, and Dota's best Talent while also subtly introducing them to a DAO structure in a positive way.

2. EDUCATE

Once they come for the world class Dota, educate them about Nouns with direct, custom created content which Nouns can use forever (Nouns explainers, DAO explainers, Web3 explainers, and even mini-docs about past successful proposals and interviews) which we will play in-between the games to show that Nouns are one of the good guys, and that this system is something they can be a part of

3. INTEGRATE

Using a POAP system, and focusing on a ""Mini Dota DAO"" designed around people who have no idea what Web3 is or don't even have crypto wallets, we aim to make the ""scary world of crypto"" something that viewers actively participate in both rewarding and fun as they collect Dota 2 themed POAPs during the event. By utilizing in-game systems, viewers can even trade these POAPs for digital cosmetics in Dota 2, giving them real value to the average viewer. 


![](https://i.imgur.com/MgG6sMz.gif)


  ### The Event


The Nounsvitational will be a world class five-day Dota 2 Tournament featuring ten of the top teams worldwide with the best broadcast talent in the Dota scene held from February 14th to February 18th. This will be a Tier 1 Dota 2 event, and the first LAN in DotA since the International World Championships in October. This will be the long-awaited return of Weplay to the Dota 2 scene (voted best Tournament Organizer in the scene, even surpassing Valve, the game's creator itself), and the first non-traditional Custom Game Mode LAN in several years. Suffice it to say, this event is going to be EXTREMELY hype for the average Dota viewer.

Using our custom map makers, we will transform the Dota 2 in-game map to be a Nounish playground, full of memes, references, and general Nouns branding so that millions of viewers will see Nouns during the games themselves. Between the games, we will utilize our content creation skills to produce and air custom Nouns video content, which will educate the viewers on Noun's culture, structure, mission, and past projects. 

Held in the Weplay Studio in Los Angeles, we will bring the best teams around the world to play, and invite as many Nouners and Nounsfolk as we can to be part of the audience, for a once in a lifetime exclusive and intimate experience. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/jO0BL0g.jpg)


### Integrating the General Public to Web3

The event itself will get people's attention: they will watch for the unique structure and for the world class competition. But our true goal will be to get the viewers to understand and integrate into the Nouns culture while they watch a fantastic event. 

Our plan for this is also 3 fold. 

1. Traditional Pre-Event marketing of Giveaways, pushing people to join the Nouns Esports Discord, follow the Nouns Social media, and even give away tickets to attend the event live. Combined with the content we create at the event, we will ensure that people WANT to watch the content we provide, so they can understand the ""scary world of crypto""
2. Contacting the best artists and creators in Dota to make custom Dota 2 POAP art, which we will give away to viewers who watch the event. This will not only drive up viewership, but with an integrated system where viewers can trade POAPs for in game cosmetic items, chances to win prizes, and other benefits, we will not only subtly introduce the average viewer to the world of NFTs, we will ensure that they have fun doing it and can trade them for real value. 
3. Creating a ""Mini Dota DAO'' prior to the event, which will not only advertise the event during its duration on Reddit and other platforms, but show the general viewers that not all NFT and Web3 projects are ""bad guys"" and that the Nouns protocol is something that is actually cool, using a real tangible example that makes the Dota 2 community a better place. 

We believe that by letting the viewers not just watch the Event, but actively participate in the event with POAP collecting, exchanging, and voting for how to ""better the world of Dota"" with a Nounish DAO system will achieve the greater purpose of the event. Come for the Dota, Stay for the Nouns.

![](https://i.imgur.com/DigBHGf.gif)

### How does this Proposal Benefit Nouns? 

* All video content created for the event (the explanatory videos, documentary-like series, etc.) and the content from The Nounsvitational itself will be usable by the Nouns community as both ""proof of concepts"" and general media Nouns will be able to use forever. This media, especially explainer videos on what are Nouns, Web3, and DAOs, have great value for future proposal endeavors.  
* Fantastic way to showcase current and past Nouns projects to first-time viewers in a captive audience. Can use already created media from other successful Proposals and expand on them with interviews from the people that made them happen
* HUGE viewership and outreach to a variety of new, interested viewers in the world of Esports (a community that has a lot of crossover with Web3 already) in a positive, productive way in a scene that views other projects very negatively 
* Cements the Nouns brand in a very valuable space with tangible, easy to gather data showcasing sign ups, viewers, and active participants for future project proposals
* Active (and trackable) onboarding of the general public to Web3 ideas and systems in a fun and dynamic way where they feel rewarded and positive about their experience, which is one of Noun's core goals   
* Growing Nouns communities by incentivizing viewers to join for access to prizes, events, and other incentives along with getting them onboard with the general Nouns ecosystem
* Come to LA! Nouns holders as well as Nouns community members can come and be part of the audience for the event, meet the players and the Talent, and have the experience of a lifetime! A great reward for your already amazing community members!

### Thank you! 

As we said, we are big fans of Nouns and everything you are trying to do in the space. We truly believe that this event will not only be incredible for Nouns, but also be a fantastic and unforgettable experience for the people in the Nouns community that join us live, virtually, and the Dota 2 community at large. We hope you will consider our proposal and would love to have any comments, feedback, and suggestions. We want to build this event for you, but also build it WITH you, to make sure we make it as NOUNISH AS POSSIBLE! 

Thank you

## ADDITIONAL INFO
Still looking for some more, condensed information? Then please continue reading!


### On Dota 2 

Currently, Dota 2 is the 2nd most played game on Steam, the biggest gaming platform in the world. It reaches a global audience with millions of active players each day, and even more viewers on it's Esports events. 

Currently, Dota 2 is experiencing a resurgence of the most viewers and players since 2013! 

![](https://i.imgur.com/ayuGSsx.png)

While most Triple A games and Esports require multi-million dollar fee to enter into the sphere with licensing fees and IP protection, Valve allows anyone to do anything with their games, giving full mod tools to players. This allows us to create a very Nounish event for a game with one of the highest viewership numbers in all of Esports. This event would only be possible in Dota, and Dota is our specialty here at Weplay. 

In terms of reach and scale of viewers, the numbers are hard to come by as China and Russia have viewership data that is not easily accessible, but viewership of top events (such as The International and the Weplay Animajor) can reach into the millions from the English audience alone.

### On the ""Mini Dota DAO""

We know the mission of Nouns is to gather together and pool resources to make the world a better place. But, the concept of a DAO and the betterment of society that can be caused their-in is something completely foreign to most people. To help the viewers understand (and subtly advertise the event) we propose creating a ""Mini DAO,"" a system that is modeled after Nouns itself! 

The process is simple. At the start of the event, we announce that we will take a percentage of the prize pool and allocate that money to ""make Dota 2 better."" Then, we will start a Reddit thread (Dota 2's primary community hub) where people are able to offer suggested Proposals for how to spend that money to make Dota better. During the duration of the tourney we will actively check in on this thread, promote it, and encourage people to add to the charitable donation if they wish for some in-game perks like having messages appear during the game on the in-game map. At the end of the event, we will have a vote and choose which idea the community suggested to allocate funds to and announce the winner. 

The point of this is for the community to be HEAVILY INVESTED in the tournament and the suggestions in the Mini DAO, but more importantly by the end of this promotion they will VERY CLEARLY understand the Nouns structure and mission, without being simply told how it works.

Prop and code written by [DigitalOil.nftr](http://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil) with **❤️** for *Nouns DAO ⌐◨-◨*
Special thanks to [solimander](https://twitter.com/_solimander_) for taking a look at the custom contract.  


##Intro

[Prop 57](https://nouns.wtf/vote/57) funded the creation of 8,250 pairs of luxury sunglasses made by [Nouns Vision](https://nounsvision.com/). Approximately 560 of those have been sold to individuals.*

[Prop 185](https://nouns.wtf/vote/185), executed recently, assigned 150/500 Nouns Vision Glasses (GLASSES) held in the Nouns DAO Treasury to 3 different groups in the Nouns ecosystem.

The aim of this prop is to distribute 50 of the remaining 350 unassigned GLASSES to Nouners. Each GLASSES is an NFT redeemable for an individual pair of physical glasses.

A custom made site @ [nounsclaims.wtf](http://nounsclaims.wtf) and contract were developed for this prop.  



# Proposal

Over 550 Nouns have been minted. Given that only 350 GLASSES in the Nouns Treasury have not been earmarked, there aren’t enough GLASSES to assign one to each Noun. Assuming that there were at most 350 Nouners, GLASSES could be distributed 1:1 per Nouner, but such distribution wouldn’t be fair as some Nouners own a disproportionate number of Nouns and thus higher weight in control of assets in the Treasury.

In addition, it wouldn’t be wise to liquidate all GLASSES in the Treasury, as we might find another good use for them in the future.

Hence, this proposal allocates 50 GLASSES to be randomly assigned (with pro-rata probability) and claimable by wallets that hold Nouns at time of distribution. The contract was designed to allow for the creation of multiple claim rounds in order to protect against GLASSES staying unclaimed forever. The claim window was set to 15 days (108,000 blocks). After 15 days have passed, Nouns DAO can pass another prop to compensate for GLASSES that went unclaimed and distribute them randomly again, and even distribute additional GLASSES if desired.

*Custom site deployed for this prop at nounsclaims.wtf*


# Technical Details

To ensure the fairest distribution possible and to make it impossible to game the system, the source of randomness for the distribution algorithm comes from Chainlink’s Verifiable Random Function ([VRF](https://chain.link/vrf)) service. 

The [Nouns DAO Executor](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10) contract was set as the owner of the deployed custom contract, so the distribution trigger can only be pulled by Nouns DAO.

This is the high level flow:

Voting —> Prop passes —> Prop executes (**) —> Function in NounsVisionVRFDistributor called

—> Chainlink VRF random number requested 

—> VRF Coordinator calls back GLASSES distribution function in NounsVisionVRFDistributor

—> Glasses are assigned to wallets that hold Nouns at that moment

—> Noun-holding wallets can claim GLASSES won by the wallet for 15 days


# Conclusion

In addition to serving as a fun distribution mechanism for GLASSES in the treasury, this prop serves as a proof of concept for how other NFTs in the Treasury could be distributed if need-be in the future. 

If this prop is well received and the DAO would like to distribute more than 50 additional GLASSES, I’ll submit a new prop leveraging a more gas-optimized contract that can handle bigger allotments.

Although I own 2 Nouns, given that I am not a guaranteed beneficiary of this prop, I will be voting in favor instead of abstaining because I’m interested in seeing the experiment play out.

Let the **🎲** begin.

200,Nouns Mail: A Token-Gated Email Address,"# Nouns Mail: A Token-Gated Email Address

_Thank you to Lakshman Sankar and Maksim Stepanenko for delegating Nouns to submit this proposal._

_We would also like to thank Prop House and Nouns voters for their support in [Open Round 13](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round-13/2392). This proposal serves to update the community on our progress and request the remaining funds necessary for the development of Nouns Mail._

## tl;dr
A token-gated email address for every Nouns holder to pseudonymously communicate and access the rest of the internet.

![](https://i.imgur.com/DpLdRUv.jpg)


## The Problem

Nouns is the most interesting experiment happening in decentralized governance and community. Yet, large swaths of the internet remain segregated from on-chain identities. Currently, Nouners cannot connect their Ethereum wallets to access Twitter, collaborate on a Figma document, or even engage on the [Nouns forum](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/).

Email addresses remain a necessity to access most platforms on the internet. Existing email providers do not natively integrate with Nouns identity, compelling Nouns to manually link aspects of their on-chain identity to off-chain platforms.

We elaborate more on this problem and discuss solutions in [The Identity Gap](https://app.skiff.com/docs/3e5c70ba-ce96-48fb-a6e7-be34b6e6c77e#tFlZDTabPylC4WiIdCQ+dRLfE2ZoWZ/uUrqBlx7cUUM=).

## The Proposal

Every Nouns owner will be able to claim a unique, token-gated email address under `@nouns.email`, or another domain decided by the DAO. Claiming this email address will be enforced by querying to an Ethereum node verifying ownership of a Noun.

**Use cases**

Here we suggest four initial categories of how our proposal can provide utility for Nouns. Should the proposal be accepted, we hope to assist in building out these use cases — like a weekly email newsletter or a `@nouns.email` domain-gated Figma.

We encourage the community to suggest additional use cases — Nouns Mail is a primitive that can unlock a Cambrian explosion of creativity.

Greater utility for owning a Noun (through Nouns Mail or otherwise) increases the demand for minting Nouns or paying royalties on secondary transactions, leading to a larger treasury for the DAO.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Egs08Y3.jpg)


**Implementation**

NounsDAO allocates a domain to be used as the official email domain for Nouns holders. We suggest `nouns.email` because of its familiarity, but any reasonable domain owned by the DAO or available on the market would suffice.

We will be using [Skiff Mail](https://skiff.com/mail), an open source, end-to-end encrypted mail provider, as the interface and mailserver for the custom domain.

All emails sent and received by Nouns email addresses are encrypted with elliptic curve crypto (Curve25519 keypairs), and emails that are sent or received to other Skiff accounts (e.g. other Nouns holders) are end-to-end encrypted. Ownership of EOAs is verified by generating a unique challenge token, requesting an ECSDA signature, and verifying the signature’s validity. A full description of Skiff’s protocol and threat model can be found at [skiff.com/whitepaper](https://skiff.com/whitepaper).

As previously mentioned, verification of Nouns ownership occur by querying an Ethereum indexer on the [Nouns token contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9c8ff314c9bc7f6e59a9d9225fb22946427edc03?a=0x0bc3807ec262cb779b38d65b38158acc3bfede10#code).

**Example User Experience**

A user connects their wallet — if it’s detected that they own a Noun, a dialog prompts them to create their email address.

![](https://i.imgur.com/XIriCUL.png)

After clicking `Claim email alias` , the page directs them to choose their unique Nouns email address.

![](https://i.imgur.com/DpLdRUv.jpg)

Afterwards, Nouners will be free to send and receive email from this address.

**Revoking Email Address Ownership**

One open question is what would happen to an account who sells or transfers his Noun after previously claiming his email address. Because owning a `@nouns.email` email address reflects one’s on-chain identity, it would be reasonable that ownership of this address is lost after losing the underlying Noun.

To implement this, Ethereum oracles on Skiff would listen for transactions where existing Noun email holders sell or transfer their last remaining Noun. Then, following an optional grace period, the email address would become disabled, becoming unusable until the account owns a Noun again.

## Deliverables and Timeline (Post-PH Update)

**Phase 1A: December 2022 [COMPLETED]**
After Prop House Open Round 13, we successfully implemented the backend endpoints for Nouns Mail. You can view a video demo [here](https://app.skiff.com/docs/fc0a6f99-ebf3-4bfb-b724-6b70ee190103#XW5%2BD4uBTemlPZw4l3hmMaVlSn9npK4frGzDJQg8Bn0%3D) (this test account owns two other NFTs, but not a Nouns and therefore is unable to claim).

**Phase 1B: January 2023**

The first phase will involve implementation of claiming Noun email addresses with the UX flow described above, including a full integration with the `@nouns.email` domain. We anticipate this taking around 2-3 weeks to fully build, test, and launch. Pending successful execution of the proposal, we are targeting a launch date of **January 20, 2022**.

**Phase 3: February 2023**

In phase 2, we plan to take an active role in creating Nounish utilities based on Nouns Mail, including newsletters, domain-gated workspaces, and integrating better verification banners for the Nouns forum. We anticipate this process taking around a month, depending on the scope of utilities. We will launch these Nounish utilities as they are created, working actively with the community throughout development.

**Tl;dr**

I will create sprite sheet art for every asset of the nouns collection to make them metaverse integration, content creation and game development ready. They will be accessible through a fun and easy to use assembler. Ask is 24eth for both the art and the builder (+ bonus game integration!).

**Project details:**

With initial prototype and testing funded with Lil Nouns Prop House, I will create game-ready sprite sheets for each asset of the Nouns collection and make them accessible through an easy to use art and animation assembler (with a bonus Metaverse Game integration included for free!)

![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZV2vRQvXx252dc73eLPrf4Fnz8N7MA8n8CytckSWPCSN)

Content creators and builders will be able to use the sprite sheets for their own proposals/productions which will fast track development and reduce costs for each of those projects.

The creation of Sprite Sheets for an NFT collection is a massive amount of work in terms of art creation and file management. Having the Nouns collection available as sprite sheets will save future content creators and every 2D game project budget and time, not to mention the value of being able to prototype and launch quickly.

 ![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmRPdwYXeWgVAB6d3oUVTXK5yWtyRHsuXfA1apfP3L2Dyr)


To put it into perspective:

In total, the art for approximately 600 Nouns traits will be animated and/or assembled into sprite sheets (each of which consists of 128 frames), results in drawing approximately 76,800 individual frames.

The Meebits DAO created SpriteSheet assets to integrate Meebits into WorldWideWebb3. The DAO paid $60k for 697 traits (64 frames each/44,608 total) and the collection was completed in a total of 10 weeks. See their proposal below.

([https://snapshot.org/#/meebitsdao.eth/proposal/0x7f1eac0510c868a00eae8082e258ea81a98f2dd310ec44bd9babcc752a787a0a](https://snapshot.org/#/meebitsdao.eth/proposal/0x7f1eac0510c868a00eae8082e258ea81a98f2dd310ec44bd9babcc752a787a0a))

That’s $60k dollars and months of production that each further project will be able to save.

Furthermore, anyone will be able to build and animate any Noun they can imagine and export an animations of a them walking and idling in 4 different directions, as well as jumping and talking !     

![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYFsy85wXRwsLwa8GsCTvHTXDt3A9m7CWLob6bfYPtzYo)


My ask is 24 ETH in funding for approximately 8 weeks of art and animated sprite sheet production (not including 8+ weeks of extended project pre-planning and prototyping with Lil Nouns Prop House 1466) and compensation for a website developer to build, integrate all Nouns assets, test and deploy the final builder website over the same period of time, not including final game integrations and fun extras.

![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPX1ugVD6un4cvMhp8jEbJdvPCMSZprqt7YnhRJxkwQgu)

Once the art is complete, I will work in collaboration with Worldwide Webb3 team, with whom I have already worked with before, to have the entire Nouns collection immediately integrated in their metaverse - with no additional cost added to the proposal.

**Why WorldWide Web3?**

They are a web3 MMORPG and have currently integrated over 160+ NFT projects (over 1 million NFTs total), with 2 years of playtime across all users and 15k trades in-game. For the recent Halloweeb event there were ~5k new players and 10k unique ones.

This Nouns game asset integration will add zero costs to this proposal because the sprite sheets are integration-ready right off the bat (just need to host on IPFS). This will also allow for proliferation of Nouns for free via in-game user engagement and official game integration promotions on social media. All included for free.

 ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ycdsn6c.gif)

**The Builder**

I like to think of this Nounish assembler website as one of many stepping stones I’d like contribute towards the future of Nounish games, for game enjoyers as well as for game creators. A creative hub where multiple Nouns collections will be accessible (Lil Nouns, Food Nouns, Sound Nouns, Gnars, etc, etc).

I have many things planned for the future of this builder: the ability to add your own traits and having a sprite sheet drawing app baked into the site to make Noun game asset development seamless. Eventually, I’d like to make this site a place where artists can come to draw, host, share, and support Nounish sprite sheet collections.

Sky is the limit with the future functionality of animated Nouns and this proposal represents the first step on the stairway to Nounish Sprite Sheet heaven!

**Deliverables**

- Sprite sheet art for every asset of the nouns collection (424) with new traits (159+) , for walking, idle and jumping animations. That's approximately 76,800 individual frames!
- A website where anyone can easily generate sprite sheets for their games, or preview and download animations for a noun. 
- Easy to use features such as a Randomise button, to generate unlimited animated nouns. 
- Two view modes on the builder: sprite sheet overview and animation preview.
- Keyboard shortcuts (arrows to move, spacebar to jump) to test animations while in preview mode
- A video introduction to sprite sheets and how to use them in games.
- Immediate in Worldwide Webb in collaboration with their team as soon as the assets are finalized. Worldwide Webb team have been contacted and have confirmed that Nouns integration would be a top priority.

**Why sprite sheets?** 
 

Sprite sheets are used in games to animate the characters on the screen. They’re a collection of single frame animations, laid out like a film strip. The most common animations for sprite sheets are the idle sequence (character moving while standing still) and walking cycles (stylistic walk as the character moves around the map)

Hi hello,

This is a simple proposal to set the reverse record from the treasury to be nouns.eth. By setting this reverse record, anyone will be able to easily send anything to Nouns by simply inputting nouns.eth.

There are over [50 Nounish DAOs](https://nouns.build) that are donating a nounders reward to Nouns, and with [Prop 190](https://nouns.wtf/vote/190) we are now minting onchain. Unless you happen to know the Nouns address by memory it's not obvious.

As Nouns continues to do things onchain (like setting up its ENS), it will be increasingly important that the community can easily recognize if something is coming from Nouns or not—setting the reverse record does just that.

I've also added a 1 ETH payment to myself for the idea.

To connect and integrate Nouns holders online & irl. We will create NounsClub, a social platform dedicated for verified Nouns.

**Why?**

* To connect Nouns holders around the world by location
* To connect with Nouns holders during your travels
* To potentially integrate Lil Nouns and other collections, based on Nouns community demand
* To create profiles of Nouns holders online, show their bio and experience to promote the brand
* To promote the Nouns brand by strengthening the community and showing it’s value to the crypto world
* To be able to build together and share knowledge and interests according to their professions [ENTREPRENEUR, DESIGNER, INVESTOR, FOUNDER, DEVELOPER, UX DESIGNER ETC].
* To organize and meet at events and local meetings
* To be able to see what projects other Nouns are working on and collaborate on them
* To be able to chat with other Nouns in chat rooms of all kinds
* To create a large gallery of Nouns event photos and build the story of the community together.

To grow …

In order for Nouns to grow to its full potential, the community must grow first and foremost, the holders must have strong ties. This also increases demand for Nouns, as new potential holders want to belong to a vibrant community that has a lot to offer.

**Our motivation**
Our goal is to bring the Nouns community together, both online and offline, and help them extract maximum community value from the NFTs they hold. We offer them a social platform tailored to their specific needs that the current social media platforms don’t meet.

**Our success story**
As of today, we have built two rapidly growing twin platforms, [PunksClub](https://www.punksclub.io), bringing together verified CryptoPunks holders, and [ApeClub](https://www.apeclub.ai), for BAYC/MAYC holders.

Our efforts in numbers (5 months, fully organic growth):

800+ verified CryptoPunk, BAYC, MAYC holders registered on our platforms
Over 200 Punk & Ape holder meetings IRL thanks to our map feature
70 holders’ projects listed on PunksClub and ApeClub
3 events for Punks & BAYC sponsored and organized by us (London, NYC, Miami)
Our platform will need some adjustments to be rolled out for Nouns, however it’s already live on the market, so there is no execution risk involved.

**NounsClub**

The only such platform that brings together Nouns holders in one place and gives them the tools to communicate, collaborate, integrate irl. :point_down:

204,Enabling a zero-fee NFT to NFT exchange for Nouns and beyond,"# Enabling a zero-fee NFT to NFT exchange for Nouns and beyond

![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-1.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-1.png)

## Goal

Enable zero-fee inter-collection trading/swaps for Nouns and Nouns derivatives while funding a self-sufficient tool for other collections to trade NFT to NFT.

### Why?

Noun “OTC” trading is currently inefficient in a web3 environment and is usually done in Discord or other social media. On-chain execution can be coordinated with an added layer of curation/search to simplify these otherwise complex trades. Interested in a noun for 100 lil nouns + 15ETH?  Looking to swap your punk for two nouns? Looking to pay additional WETH to trade your higher noun ID for a sub-100 ID? These trades can be posted to the atomic0 exchange with no fees, be executable by anyone, and can all be open at once until one of them is filled.

**Today, there is no NFT-to-NFT exchange, only OTC trading tools. Nouns can enable this radically new style of trading, which is uniquely possible with NFTs while incentivizing Nouns proliferation.**

## The proposal

Across the entire swap exchange experience, the benefits of Noun-involved trades are highlighted:

![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-2.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-2.png)

The atomic0 team will use funding from this proposal to meet the deliverables and timeline (below) **and guarantee zero-fee swaps where Nouns + derivatives are involved for the lifetime of the atomic0 exchange**. Where Nouns swaps are found throughout the experience, for example, on an individual punk page with a Noun-involved swap, the swap is highlighted as being a “Nounish” zero-fee swap. Swaps comprised solely of non-Noun assets (BAYCs, Punks, etc.) will be subject to a 0.5% gross fee on the estimated value of the swap.

### Implementation details and mocks

The swap creation page post-asset selection:

![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-5.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-5.png)

### Considerations

- **No fees, ever, where Noun or Noun derivatives are included in swaps for the lifetime of the exchange.**
- An infinite number of swaps can be created (using Seaport) without the NFTs leaving your wallet until an order is filled.
- Supports multi-sig ([Safe](https://safe.global/)) from day 1.
- Opensea “Marked as stolen” support/warning.
- The exchange utilizes Seaport (and the Opensea conduit, so no approvals, if approved on OS), and NFTs don’t leave your wallet until a swap is executed.
- We **plan to bootstrap with Nouns DAO funding and provide benefits to the Nouns DAO with our no-fee swap product. We plan on a sustainable long-term roadmap via fees (0.5%) on other collections where Nouns are not involved in trades (e.g., Wrapped Punks to BAYC)**
- Additional proposals/products are possible with fee distribution back to the treasury after we’ve cut our teeth.
- atomic0 is not yet VC-backed and is wholly founder-owned and operated.

### Our Story with Nouns/web3

We launched a proof of concept zero-fee NFT marketplace which was the first on Ethereum to have both zero fees and [optional royalties (back in June)](https://twitter.com/atomic0Trade/status/1542282578291372032). Several Nouners used it to field OTC interest in their NFTs, but notably, [ayyybee used it to sell Noun #227](https://twitter.com/a0reverserekt/status/1565441676365029379), and [**vapeape (nounder) used it to sell his V1 Cryptopunk**](https://twitter.com/a0reverserekt/status/1563972653119025152). Many other traders and collectors in the space have executed trades on the platform, including [Franklin](https://twitter.com/franklinisbored/status/1574193716809662464), who actively lists his apes on [atomic0.com](https://atomic0.com/). While I don’t yet have a Noun, I’m [still closely watching and bidding on the auctions](https://twitter.com/robertjfclarke/status/1582833840447332353). Last month, we also built the [first WETH, non-custodial bidding solution for punks](https://twitter.com/atomic0Trade/status/1606001795985453057). This proposal was made possible with Noun delegations by [cryptopunks.eth](https://twitter.com/cryptopunks_ce) and [brennen.eth](https://twitter.com/brennen_eth). A big thank you to all the Nouns who gave feedback on this prop before it went on-chain!

## Deliverables and timeline

- Upon proposal execution → Noun fees are removed on [atomic0.com](http://atomic0.com) for all Noun listings, including derivatives.
- Four weeks from proposal execution → Individual Noun to Noun or Noun to Other 721 (wrapped punks, BAYC, etc.) swap creation/execution enabled.
- Eight weeks from proposal execution → Trait and ID array on the “want” side of trades enabled.
- Stretch goal → Automated recurring emails with the top swap offers received for your wallet.
- Stretch goal → Automated price adjustments and bulk swap creation when Seaport 1.2 is deployed on-chain.

## FAQ

**Why not build this as a stand-alone Nouns-specific website (e.g., nouns-swaps.com)?**

- **We’ve seen project-specific marketplaces come into the fold recently, such as [Apecoinmarketplace](https://www.apecoinmarketplace.com/collections/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d) and [nounish.market](https://www.nounish.market/collections/0x9c8ff314c9bc7f6e59a9d9225fb22946427edc03). The utilization is near-zero compared with generalized marketplaces (Opensea, Looksrare, etc.). Embedding the aforementioned noun-specific benefits into the larger atomic0 swap ecosystem will incentivize and propagate nouns more than isolating noun swaps onto a Noun-only exchange. In other words, if people can also use the platform to trade their punks for apes, there’s a higher chance of Noun propagation due to incentives (no fees) for Noun-involved trades.**

How does this contrast with [Proposal 46 (Marketplace Pod Proposal)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/46)?

- Our roadmap is entirely centered around enabling NFT to NFT trading, a stretch goal of proposal 46 ([noun.market](https://noun.market/)). Our deliverables focus on NFT to NFT, which makes for minimal overlap with [noun.market](http://noun.market)’s ETH to NFT focus. We see noun.market as complementary in some areas, including derivative identification for collection no-fee designation.

Wen open source?

- We intend to open-source many components over time to allow for community contributions to the product, specifically on the front end. This will happen as we enable on-chain order creation and other helpful functionality throughout the development.

How does this contrast with existing OTC tools such as NFTTrader, Sudoswap OTC, and Swap Kiwi?

- The websites mentioned above are great for situations where you’ve already found a counterparty for your swap. For example, you own a Noun, have fielded interest on Discord, and have found someone to swap your Noun for a punk. We take it up a notch with an exchange-style format allowing you to field interest across many collections and NFTs simultaneously. You could make the same noun swap offer to 100 punks of your liking, all at once, and have them all open and executable on-chain until someone fills the swap. We also support trait, collection, and ID-array bids and have many added layers of discoverability for swaps.

![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-6.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-6.png)

Will this require ongoing Nouns funding for maintenance?

- Nouns support will sustain the platform's development through our roadmap mentioned above. Until fee-generating swaps from other collections, such as BAYC (where Nouns aren’t included), can sustain ongoing costs to operate the exchange. We may put through other proposals to add additional functionality or for long-term operational support, depending on community interest in the exchange.

Do you have a plan for on-chain swap storage?

- Off-chain swap storage is cheaper to implement and doesn’t require additional helper contracts, so we’re prioritizing them here for our MVP. We are open to implementing on-chain swap listings depending on the appetite, utilization, and community feedback. Fortunately, Seaport does allow for the storage of order hashes in their contract, so there is undoubtedly a path to implementation.

**⌐◧-◧ TL;DR: Nouns On The Ground 2023** is requesting 520 ETH in funding for one year, which will allow NounsOTG to nounify 18 events during 2023, with a focus on 4 major events; NFT Paris, ETH Denver, NFT Toronto and Burning Man. Will there be a wooden effigy of Noun 0 burned IRL at Burning Noun? *Read on to find out.* 

![](https://i.imgur.com/eZtVziA.png)

Setting the **NounsOTG 2023 Event Calendar** at the beginning of the year will allow other builders to have a solid foundation of nounish proliferation hot spots for the year. In order to capture the content to make the feeling of these experiences available for everyone, NounsOTG will produce a Docuseries that focuses on the organization and activation of each event. A ""Behind The Scenes"" inner workings of NounsOTG, telling the story of a successful builder, proliferating the Nouns meme IRL and OTG.

![](https://i.imgur.com/LQ7aamq.png)

Nouns On The Ground also commits to doing a total of 144 live podcasts over the course of the year called **""Nouns On The Air (NounsOTA)""**, where we highlight People, Places and Things during the planning, execution and proliferation of these activations. People will be able to participate in these shows regardless of being at the event or not, further connecting the nounish community with the IRL OTG world of Nouns.

![](https://i.imgur.com/krMaqJz.png)

Nouns On The Ground has been highlighting people, places, things and ⌐◧-◧ for the past 6 months. A more in depth look at these past 6 months On The Ground can be found at the end of this Proposal and on the NounsOTG [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@nounsotg), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS_phF_niMXOADdx694y68w) & [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NounsOTG). These are all great places to DYOR! There are separate forums (164) to discuss each NounsOTG event and each NounsOTA episode in the brand new NounsOTG [Discord](https://discord.gg/nousnotg); meant to be a hub for OTG conversations for each event and podcast.

![](https://i.imgur.com/zfdIGFm.jpg)


**⌐◧-◧ Nounifying Crypto and NFT Native Events**
All events in green above are Crypto/NFT native events. These activations will include nounish giveaways, interviews with event participants and spreading the Nouns meme in a variety of different ways based on the type of event. QR Codes, POAPs and social media analytics will be used to measure reach and provide more information attached to specific events/campaigns. For more examples of this type of OTG proliferation, please reference the Prop 110 Case Studies at the end of this Proposal. 

**⌐◧-◧ Nounifying Popular Social Events**
All events in pink above are social events. In addition to NFT/Crypto native events, NounsOTG will attend and Nounify prolific social events that are in alignment with Nouns branding and the larger brand recognition that we could obtain this year. These social events include Noun by NounWest, Nounchella, Cannes Film Festival, Tribeca Film Festival, Burning Noun and SXSW Sydney. For more examples of this type of OTG proliferation, please reference the Prop 110 Social Experiments at the end of this Proposal. 

**⌐◧-◧ Travel Costs - Flights & Accommodation**
These costs cover 2-3 airline tickets (depending on the size of the event) to events, insurance and checked bag fees. For each event, the travel expenses/airline ticket price was calculated with 10% added to the total cost to account for price changes over the next several weeks during the Proposal process. Accommodation is covered at each event for Aubtoshi and production crew members. For each event, the accommodation price was calculated with 10% added to the total cost to account for price changes over the next several weeks during the Proposal process.

**⌐◧-◧ Transportation/Per Diem Costs**
During OTG activations, costs accrue around each activation and social event including transportations or ""Uber costs"" as well as food for working team members, water and other toiletries or event supply items that might need to be purchased. An industry standard of $100 per diem per person on the ground covers these costs. These specific costs are calculated at the price of 2 individuals receiving per diem per day on the ground.

**⌐◧-◧ SWAG - Merch & Giveaways & Activations**
SWAG is anything that the NounsOTG team will be giving away as a brand tool during these activations. This includes stickers, T-shirts and other nounish items. NounsOTG has an ongoing relationship with builders in the DAO to ensure that these items come from builders who work within the ecosystem.

**⌐◧-◧ Aubtoshi, Production & Administrative Costs**
Aubtoshi's payment for NounsOTG management on Prop 110 was $3,600 per month to manage 6 major events over 6 months. With the amount of events doubling on this Proposal, Aubtoshi's NounsOTG management and expertise to do so will double to ensure full time focus on each of these OTG events. Production costs are paid on a per event basis and cover capturing content while OTG, editing and distributing the content over the various OTG social media channels. Administrative costs cover the management of calendars, shipment tracking, live production schedule management, vendor coordination, and overall schedule and time management of NounsOTG events and activations.

**⌐◧-◧ NounsOTG x Activations** All events in yellow above are the main activations. These 4 main OTG activations in 2023 are NFT Paris, ETH Denver, NFT Toronto and Burning Noun. NounsOTG has laid out the budget for each of these events below:

![](https://i.imgur.com/FydwNMI.png)

**⌐◧-◧ NFT Paris** is holding its second annual NFT event. After selling out a smaller venue last year, the team has more than doubled down with the iconic Grand Palais, which sits right across from the Eiffel Tower. John Hammon's successful nounish activation throughout Paris, France helped bring new crypto users to the forefront, all with their eye on attending this event. Aubtoshi is already approved as a speaker. Our budget would account for a shared Platinum Sponsorship with Poap.fr (same level as Ledger), items needed for a booth activation, a speaker slot and a budget to throw a smaller/more intimate activation to celebrate the end of this event. We will begin immediately implementing a production schedule of this event if this Proposal is successfully passed. ([event website](https://www.nftparis.xyz/))

**⌐◧-◧ ETH Denver** takes over the entire downtown Denver, Colorado area for a week to celebrate and educate event goers on NFTs, crypto and the web3 space in general. This event is known for having a jam packed daytime schedule with few social event options in the evening. NounsOTG has the opportunity to sponsor and produce an artist focused social event for 1-2 days during the event. The private location (think giant warehouse with open walls for artists) is on hold with nounish friends and we will begin immediately implementing a production schedule of this event if this Proposal is successfully passed. ([event website](https://www.ethdenver.com))

**⌐◧-◧ NFT Toronto** is another first annual event celebrating the increase in NFT and crypto native users in the Toronto, Canada area. One of the founders is involved with the Solana Nouns team and is determined for this event to be nounish. Budgets account for sponsorship opportunities and the chance to create a social, interactive nounish experience. *(website launching soon)*

![](https://i.imgur.com/NuKAAhk.png)

**⌐◧-◧ Burning Noun (Burning Man)** is an event known by people from around the world as one of the most dynamic and unique art festivals in existence. For one week, an entire city is formed with the center point being a wooden structure called ""The Man"". All attendees are encouraged to participate by creating art cars and wooden structures of their own that can be ceremoniously burned at the end of the event. We want to have a focus on Burning Man as a proof of concept for larger event participation in purely socially events. We will construct and burn a wooden effigy of Noun 0, releasing energies and paying homage to the origin Noun, while lighting the way towards the future of all Nouns. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/CXxl9zG.png)

**⌐◧-◧ NounsOTG Multi-sig (3/5 Signature)**
The NounsOTG Multi-sig will be a 3/5 signature multi-sig that will disperse funds on a monthly basis based on the timing of each event/prop. All event budgets must be transferred a minimum of two months prior to the event itself. All events that take place in under two months will be transferred immediately upon a successfully passed Proposal. The signers on this Proposal are well versed in the tools used to manage this amount of seperate transactions.

**⌐◧-◧ Any Changes In the Multi-Sig Will Be Made Public**
If for any reason during the course of this Proposal a Signer needs to step-down and fill their position, all changes made to the signers of the wallet will be made public. 

**⌐◧-◧ Event Changes and Cancelations**
If for any reason a listed event cancels or postpones to a date that is no longer possible due to schedule conflicts, the signers of the multi-sig can decide if changing the event is possible. If a change is not possible, funds pertaining to that specific event will be sent back to the DAO. All changes that require these decisions will be made public.

**⌐◧-◧ Proposal Transparency & Proposer Accountability**
NounsOTG wants to be an example of going above and beyond. We believe that reporting has multiple benefits including data generation to assess further involvement with IRL events/activations in the future. It also helps future proposers understand the hard costs associated with IRL events. This prop and supporting documentation can be used as a measurement tool to evaluate future activations of this type. We hope to continue to serve the community and represent Nouns DAO IRL.

Why is NounsOTG the right fit for continued IRL representation of Nouns? [NounsOTG](https://www.nounsotg.wtf) has been operating within the nounish ecosystem for more than 6 months through each of the following on-chain Proposals and NSFW funding rounds:

* NSFW - [NFT NYC 2022](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-on-the-ground-nft-nyc-update/1471) (first official activation)
* On-Chain - [Proposal 110](https://nouns.wtf/vote/110)
* NSFW - [Michigan University Final Home Game](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nounsotg-x-stadium-club-327-charity-beer-garden/2958)
* On-Chain - [Proposal 166](https://nouns.wtf/vote/166)

In July 2022, Nouns On The Ground had a successfully passed on-chain Proposal, [Proposal 110](https://nouns.wtf/vote/110), which was designed to proliferate Nouns over the course of 6 months. We have had so many valuable lessons from these experiences that will allow NounsOTG to make this next six months a valuable investment on the DAO's end when it comes to IRL integration of the meme.

These proposals have allowed NounsOTG to interact with 11 different on-chain proposals within the nounish ecosystem. This has evolved our understanding of how to interact with and educate the public on the Nouns meme and the ecosystem as a whole, while meeting other builders and learning their stories.

We have included case studies and data sets for the DAO and future proposers. Our learning experience benefits everyone.

**⌐◧-◧ #1 OTG Takeaway From Each Event**
* Positive Interactions Are Memorable (Los Angeles, California)
* Repetition Is Key (Hollywood, California)
* The Meme Is Engaging (Denver, Colorado)
* Collabs Create Success (New York City, New York)
* Hackers Build On Nouns (Berlin, Germany)
* Content Is King (Munich, Germany)
* Representation Matters (London, England)
* Fans Make Brands (Ann Arbor, Michigan)
* NFT Art Is In Pop Culture (Miami Beach, Florida)

Please refer to the case studies provided for the 6 main events and 3 additional social experiments that were covered within [Proposal 110](https://nouns.wtf/vote/110) as well as the Michigan University event covered by [NSFW](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nounsotg-x-stadium-club-327-charity-beer-garden/2958).

**⌐◧-◧ OTG Example of Larger Activation Funding - Proposal 166 Budget**
To get a better understanding of event budget breakdowns as it relates to the involvement of NounsDAO, let's look at the Prop 166 Budget that was recently executed. The Rose Parade x Rose Bowl is a 10 day OTG activation with key 3 events happening that require venues, coordination of over 15 brand ambassadors, proliferation of thousands of nounish items and travel/accommodation costs for 4 OTG members.

![](https://i.imgur.com/N67B3GG.png)

It is important to note that although content creation and dissemination was not outlined in Prop 110 as a deliverable, it became clear to NounsOTG during our first 6 month trial that content capturing and creation are vital when proliferating IRL to create value from the event even after it has been completed. All content you see on these case studies is being scheduled to be distributed on the [NounsOTG YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS_phF_niMXOADdx694y68w), [NounsOTG TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@nounsotg) and [NounsOTG Twitter](https://twitter.com/NounsOTG) accounts over the next several weeks to maintain a stream of content while we capture this next phase of material. I have spoken at length about these various events on different Twitter spaces and podcasts  such as [The Noun Square](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare), the [Noun O’Talk Podcast](https://noun-o-talk.cohostpodcasting.com/episodes/nft-nyc-recap-with-juan-hernandez-pixel-noun-142-and-aubtoshi) and the [Nounsfolk Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/77gZtqxYido8xJ2yU0kn8G?si=GMVXlN81SEi12Abd_P6xgQ).

[![](https://imgur.com/8yG7T5J.jpg)](https://youtu.be/IeFjt2HFvTU)

Since the first extension, David Horvath via Nouns Studio1 has:

- Made introductions to and continues ongoing discussions with a top executive and now the CEO/founder of one of the “top two” animation movie studios based in the US: intent is development arrangement for co-production of animated content based on Nouns.
- Introduction to a well known motion picture director and producer.
- Introduction to a leading children’s publishing author and his web team.
- Pushed the Sofubi figure project closer to completion, and put together a Nouns exhibition at a leading retail space in Shinjuku with the Nouns sofubi in collaboration with 12 leading creators based in Japan, which resulted in cementing Noun’s position with LOFT in Ginza and being invited to join “pop box”, an exclusive “traveling creator retail promotion” now in it’s 16th year, featured at all LOFT locations in Japan over a 30 month period. The above mentioned exhibition featured Nouns accessory products, produced in small quantities in support of the sofubi project’s primary objective, which were well received and will continue.

Delays: Sofubi paint mask factory has seen delays due to covid restrictions, now back on track for paint mask to be ready 1Q 2023, with Nouns sofubi hitting LOFT shelves in the Spring.

Proposal for Studio1 extension 2023:

David proposes to extend Studio1 for one full year:
- Continue the current conversation with the above mentioned animation studio,
- Discussions with an additional leading studio currently expressing interest.
- Pursue conversations with studio leads recently moved to new positions at top studios.
- In person on the ground in Japan to take efforts from this current extension to next steps, via in person meetings with potential high brand retailers and desired collaboration partners.
- In person on the ground in Seoul, to begin a modified version of the Studio1 approach for Japan, in the Korean market: including a similar collaborative artist exhibition, discussions with potential high brand retailers and desired collaboration partners.
Initiate discussions with leading individuals, executives and firms operating in the character licensing business and consumer products arena. (example: meet with SPC in Seoul to discuss potential collaborations with their brands for the Korean market.)

Compensation: $200,000.00 USD equivalent for one year, start date Jan 4, 2023.
UPDATED:
- No extra expense for travel between US, Japan and Korea. 
- Expected sofubi expenses:
Paint mask estimate has come in at ¥220,000 (about $1600.00 as of todays exchange rate)
per piece cost for Nouns sofubi:
$10 blank, between $18-$30 fully painted, depending on paint applications
I would recommend starting with 50 pieces to go to loft, fully painted in the spring/ summer
So another $1500 usd (depending on exchange rate in the spring) for those first 50

**Total amount: $203,100.00 USDC for one year** (via Sablier)

The best things in life are worth waiting for and either you take from something that has already been made or you create something entirely new.

This proposal is to introduce the ever growing Nouns community to the world of owning premium spirits in your Nft investment portfolio without leaving your front door and, to introduce the world of whisky to Nouns. Our first Nouns DAO offering will be to create and craft a premium, 3-year old Nouns Whisky. Our model is sustainable and returns a percentage of profits back to the DAO.

There are distilleries around the world that have whisky (distilled twice) or whiskey (distilled 3 times) in their warehouses ready to be sold in a barrel or a bottle format to anyone that can then slap a label onto the bottle, create a concept around it and call it your own. This is awesome and is easily accessible for any builder to start something overnight, but why do that if you have the infrastructure, patience and expertise to create something that is authentic and entirely new. This product is then born with the help of the community and collectively we can watch our creation mature, flourish and proliferate over a span of 3 years, and then watch as it leaves the distillery for the real world to take on a life of its own as it finds its way to your home, bar or restaurant.

This project will first take shape with an oak barrel, and Whisky barrel or cask trading is becoming more popular across the world and is considered a better investment in the long-run as whisky is an appreciating asset and therefor probably more valuable down the line than most of the nft projects that you have floating around in your wallet and hidden folder. With Nouns Whisky we’re making it easy, with less barriers to entry, so that anyone with 0.35 Eth in their wallet can buy 1 of 500 barrels of whisky (25L / 6.6 Gallons) on OpenSea. Your whisky barrel will be stored securely in the warehouse and is now tied to your wallet address. This is the beauty of provenance and PBT (physically backed tokens) that record your purchase and ownership on the blockchain.

Ok, you now own a barrel of whisky in a beautiful city in Cape Town, South Africa. You probably haven’t visited our country, you can’t see your barrel of whisky in person, but you’re excited to own something that is actually tangible, real and valuable. So now you must hodl your nft as the whisky ageing process takes 3 years until it is ready to be bottled and shipped. This is why we’ll be installing a live camera feed in the warehouse and doing quick vlogs during the setup phase so that Nouners can watch us start this journey together. And remember you have a cool as f**k, 1 of 1 Nouns Barrel Head artwork that represents 1 of 500 Nouns Whisky barrels in the warehouse, this is ground breaking for the ecosystem! With everyones help this could possibly be the best long-term investment that you’ll make in Web3 in 2023 and only for roughly $450. But the real question is, can your paper hands become diamond hands and hold onto this token until the next bull run?

And now to introduce ourselves. Hi guys, my name is Pierre and I’m the Project Manager for Nouns Whisky, South Africa and this is Andre the Master Distiller, he has won various awards and has been distilling Whisky for 7 years. We’re both makers, builders, love Nouns, everything Web3 and we’re asking for an investment of 102 Eth to create the first of many Nouns Whisky projects over the next 7 years until we reach 2030 when we can release a 7-year old premium whisky born from the Web3 treasury of the Nouns DAO. We will keep 5 barrels aside for this, as it is the perfect goal for us to collectively pursue with ‘One Noun, Every Day, Forever’ on the blockchain. We believe in the ethos of for Nouns by Nouners and then inviting newcomers to join us. This project is our contribution to the Nouns virtuous cycle and a global cultural revolution. We invite you to take a look at our sustainable proposal & vision, and please feel free to ask us any questions in the Nouns Whisky Discord or Discourse with links below, let’s make this happen and do something cool in the consumables category! 

*Jim Beam x Mila is the perfect campaign to sum up our Nouns Whisky project in 30 sec and honestly, we didn't even know this advert existed until a few weeks back, as the collaboration was launched in 2015. Similar ads can be created for future nounish whisky content.*

**Financially what do we need to make this concept come to life? Let’s break it down simply:**

- 10 Eth for production management costs, merchandising, design & local content creation.
- 20 Eth for global marketing, strategic partnerships & paid advertising over 24 months (This amount will be held in a wallet, in Eth and deployed as needed).
- 20 Eth for 100 oak barrels, spirits & labor. These are owned by Nouns DAO.
- 52 Eth for the facility infrastructure that will produce & house the barrels for 3 years (This amount will be converted to USD/ZAR and kept in a South African bank account that can be viewed upon request by the DAO as it will be used to pay monthly expenses over a period of 36 months).

Total ask: 102 Eth (in-depth breakdown below Q&A)

**NOUNS WHISKY ⌐◨-◨ : The In-Depth Business Details.**

---

**1. The inception and execution is broken down into 6 x Phases.**

***Phase 1 - Nouns Nfts - January & February 2023***

* 500 Barrel Heads are designed & generated and uploaded to OpenSea manually. No minting site. View the first batch here: [Nouns Whisky Barrel Nfts](https://opensea.io/collection/nouns-whisky-barrels)
* Nft sales / claiming starts on the 15th of February 2023 with a soft launch.
* The DAO holds 100 barrels and can decide how these are allocated.
* The distillery holds 400 barrels and these will all be sold to the public at 0.35 eth each.
* The project does not need to sell all of the Nfts at the soft launch as this is an ongoing project.

***Phase 2 - February & March of 2023***

* The Pienaar & Son Distillery will source and acquire the 25L Oak Barrels.
* A 3-year lease on a storage facility will be negotiated and locked down for 36 months.
* Sin tax licensing will be registered for the project.
* Insurance for the barrels will be setup.
* A security company will be contracted to make regular rounds at the facility during the projects lifespan.
* Employment of labor will be needed to set the barrels up in the storage facility.
* Public Liability insurance will be set up for the labourers & potential visitors.
* A pallet jack will be bought to move the barrels, bottles & liquid around in the facility.
* Liquid for the whisky barrels will be produced.
* Holding tanks (2x200L + 2x500L) will be acquired for the facility.
* Internet & a permanent computer is set up in the storage facility.
* A camera is installed in the storage facility so that anyone can view the process of the barrels being set up via the Pienaar & Son website.
* The distilling of the whisky barrels starts in mid April.

***Phase 3 - March & April of 2023***

* Provenance / ownership of the barrels will be recorded with the Nfts ID and these Nfts can be re-sold from the launch date over the span of 36 months until the whisky is ready to be bottled in 2026.
* A press release will be compiled explaining the collaboration between the Nouns Dao project & the Pienaar & Son Distillery.
* This will be sent out in late March to various news outlets across South Africa and to select Nft, whisky, food & beverage news websites.
* A more in-depth Nouns Whisky website will be created.

***Phase 4 - May 2023***

* 4 x Small events will be held at the distillery with Nouns memorabilia on display.

***Phase 5 - June 2023 onwards***

* The barrels will be monitored by the distillery over the coming months and updates will be added to the Nouns Whisky website for all holders to see.

***Phase 6 - March / April / May / June 2026***

* The whisky will be ready to be bottled & packaged for the Nouns DAO & the public holders.
* 40 x (500 ml) bottles will be available from each barrel, also accounting for liquid evaporation over 36 months.
* The owner of the barrel will then be able to ship these bottles to a specified destination across the world. P&P / Shipping will be for the holders cost. Or the holder can enter a storage agreement with the Distillery and the whisky can age further. 
* If the holder chooses to redeem their barrel and put their 40 bottles up for individual sales on our OpenSea page, this is an option.

**2. Nouns Whisky South Africa Project Costs:**

For this project to proceed, upfront costs are necessary to create the Nouns Whisky infrastructure and to produce the liquid. We are asking for 102 Eth with the aim for the DAO to recoup this investment through their 100 Nft sales if they choose to do so. Pienaar & Son have a proven track record in running a profitable alcohol business for over 7 years.

Why have we chosen Nouns Whisky as the product that will kick-start Nouns proliferation in South Africa? Sustainability is the answer. Alcohol products have played a fundamental role in supporting and helping to pioneer the art & music scenes across South Africa over the last 20 years, and now with this business plan Nouns can join the playground.

**20 ETH ~ WHISKY PRODUCTION**

The bulk purchases here will be made in the first 2 months of the project.

* Purchase Oak barrels (100 guaranteed to be produced for the DAO)
* Produce new-make spirit to fill the oak barrels. The oak + ageing time is what gives whisky its characteristic flavour.
* Depending on public sales, the additional barrels will be purchased and liquid distilled.

**52 ETH ~ FACILITY & LEGAL**

These expenses will be kept in an account that can be viewed upon request by the DAO as it will be used to pay monthly expenses over the 36 months. Transparency with this spend is important to us. 

* 3 Year storage facility lease
* 2 Month rental deposit fee
* Storage facility insurance for 3 years
* Liquor licensing & legal fees for 3 years
* 4 x Holding tanks
* 1 x Pallet jack
* Wooden shelving for the barrels
* Security fees for 3 years
* Labor 
* Public Liability insurance for 3 years
* 1 x Computer and hi-res camera setup
* High-speed internet rental for 3 years for live facility feed

**10 ETH ~ PROJECT PRODUCTION**

These expenses are part retro-funding and will be split between Pierre, Andre and the specific suppliers need in the first 2 months. We have been extremely frugal with these line items to reduce the overall production costs. Please note that the R&D process to introduce Nouns to South Africa started in June 2022.

* 2 Month Nft design & brand development fees
* 6 Months design & South African marketing material fees
* 6 Months social media fees
* 6 Months project management fees
* 1 Months PR agency fees for the Press Release
* 4 x Eventing fees in June 2023
* Basic website development
* 150 x Nouns t-shirts & tote bags (given away for free at the distillery)
* Photographer for content creation
* Accounting fees for tax declaration

**20 ETH ~ GLOBAL MARKETING, PAID ADVERTISING & STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS**

Please note, this amount can be deployed by the DAO in a multi-sig over time, it is not needed upfront. We arrived at this amount after feedback from our discussion in our Nouncil meeting.

- Identify key food & beverage websites and contact them for product reviews and paid advertising over 12 months. 
- Connect with Nft News outlets for reviews and paid advertising.
- Connect with traditional media outlets for advertorials & press release information.
- Connect with established builders in the Nouns ecosystem to create paid content for Nouns Whisky.
- Look at ways to utilise digital billboards with Nouns Whisky assets.
- Get Nounish studio involved to create some video content.

---

**3. How much ROI can the Nouns DAO expect from the Nouns Whisky project?**

- 102 Eth investment
- Produces 100 barrels for the DAO
- 40 bottles per barrel = 4000 bottles
- If the DAO chooses to hold onto all the barrels till 2026. There will be a $100 reserve price per bottle on OpenSea = $4000 per barrel
- If the DAO sells all 4000 bottles in 2026/2027 at $100 each that = $400 000 = 300 Eth at todays price of $1 333,25 from an 102 Eth investment. This is a best case scenario but conservative at $100 auction price per bottle. 
- If the DAO sells all 100 barrels at 1 Eth each, forecasting they reach this price during the 36th month period, the DAO will make 100 Eth to recoup the 102 Eth spend.
- Besides the 100 barrels that the Nouns DAO owns, it will receive an additional 10% of the net income of the distilleries Nouns Whisky sales from the 400 barrels on OpenSea. This amount will be sent to Maty to record and confirm that the payment has been made once we reach a sold out position.
- The DAO will also receive a 2.5% royalty from all of the sales on OpenSea in perpetuity (barrels & bottles).

Here is the distilleries current business model and you can see their whisky here: [Tiny Batch Whisky - Heavy Char – Pienaar & Son](https://pienaarandson.co.za/products/tiny-batch-whisky-heavy-char)

Please note that these figures are based on the distillery already having invested in the infrastructure to create these batches 5 years ago and with 225 litre barrels.

**Cost to produce and store first 2 x (185L after evaporation) Barrels = ± 2.5 Eth (ageing period - 4 years)**

Total bottles produced = 1100
Bottle retail price in South Africa = 0,032 Eth each
Gross income from bottle sales in South Africa = 35,42 Eth
**Time taken to sell out = 19 days**

**Nett profit from bottle sales = 23,20 Eth**
(Ex Advertising) ROI = 994%

*Awards: World Whisky Awards - Single grain, Single cask - Bronze Medal*

**5. So what does this mean in the long-run for Nouns Whisky?**

1) When the Whisky ageing process comes full circle in 2026 we can start selling the whisky across South Africa.
2) We can offer the Whisky to bars across South Africa.
3) We can offer the Whisky to music festivals across South Africa.
4) We can offer the Whisky to major liquor outlets across South Africa.
5) We can create pop-up bars and sell the Whisky directly to consumers.
6) With our e-commerce store we can sell bottles directly to customers.
7) We can offer the product to an international audience. 

---

**6. What does this do to create sustainability and proliferation?**

1) Alcohol companies make great margins on their products that creates regular cash flow as alcohol is available to consume 12 months of the year. You can sell the product 365 days a year as it is not a seasonal business plan.
2) Nouns Whisky can invest financially in music events, artists, musicians and any other strategic partnerships with profit made from sales in South Africa. This is key if you're going to build a brand with the goal of it being sustainable to 2030 and beyond.
3) With profits the business can also create social responsibility campaigns and donate to charities to do community cleanups and more. 

---

**7. Why should Nouns invest in financially sustainable projects.**

This is an opportunity for Nouns to branch further into the African continent with a sustainable business plan. We can give a % of profits back to the DAO in perpetuity, R&D other product lines and turn the investment into a long lasting brand building endeavour. It is that simple and makes this investment a winning formula.

---

**8. What happens with the project in 2024, 2025, 2026 and onwards so that we can release more products?**

With the profits that we generate from the sale of the 400 Nouns Whisky barrel nfts we will release another batch of whisky each year that will mature for another 3 years, this will be available to the public again to trade and this will allow the project to remain sustainable without requesting the DAO to fund us each year. We can continue to create more content, on-board new buyers and continue the proliferation of Nouns Whisky and best of all we can continue to produce a 2.5% secondary sales royalty in perpetuity for the Nouns DAO from OpenSea nfts, and 10% of the primary nft barrel sales every year. We will also be looking at R&D opportunities in the coffee & bottled water categories as an additional way to introduce Nouns to South Africa and create a ROI for Nouns DAO.

**9. And now it's time to showcase our brand assets, look & feel!**

**10. Our experience in the music industry with alcohol brands.**
    
To strengthen our pitch and to showcase our experience in the alcohol and music industry: here is a music video that we helped produce in South Africa and it has accumulated 7.7 million views. There are key elements that played a role in the creation of this video and first and fore-mostly the Afrikaans band needs to write a song that the nation wants to play on repeat, they hit this for a home run. Alcohol companies sponsor culture and this could easily be a video that Nouns Whisky could have produced as Jagermeister paid for it. We have a lot of opportunities down the line to work with musicians in South Africa.

We helped the same band release a Vinyl and EP album backed by a physical and collectible box of beers and there was a free album inside. This could have also been a project backed by a Nft. The box of beers was then distributed across South Africa to more than 100 stores where fans could buy the box of beers. There was a limited amount and fans were seen standing outside of the liquor outlets waiting for the stores to open. This is something that Nouns Whisky could have sponsored. I’m using these projects to showcase the power of what an alcohol business & project can do with profits / marketing budget. This is the same model that Jagermeister uses, they sell bottles and use a portion of this income to connect with culture and introduce their brand in countries across the world.

***Pierre Coetzee**:*

* Proposal

* Nouns Events

***Andre Pienaar:*** [https://pienaarandson.co.za/](https://pienaarandson.co.za/)

*I can confidently say that whisky was always part of the plan, and one of the cornerstone reasons I wanted to start the Pienaar & Son distillery. With the foundation of my fathers’ knowledge of building beautifully sophisticated distillation equipment, and my biochemistry and chemistry degree, I knew we would have a significant advantage in the understanding and manipulation of the fermentation and distillation processes required to produce a world class whisky. There is a lot more at play than making some moonshine and chucking it in a barrel.*

***Pierre Coetzee:*** [https://futurenow.world/](https://futurenow.world/)

*Over a span of 15 years spent in Cape Town & South Africa, active in the skateboarding, music & art scenes: I’ve been fortunate to pioneer and explore these movements through small investments into supporting skateboarders, musicians & artists careers. I’ve been able to work with the majority of the alcohol & lifestyle brands with sponsorship procurement and speciality brand activations & development. Over the past 20 months I’ve navigated the crypto art industry as a creator & collector, following Punk 4156, his journey, the sale of his Crypto Punk and the inception of the Nouns DAO initiative / collective. We’re in a new era of a cultural revolution supported by cryptocurrencies & DAO’s, this is why I’m approaching Nouns DAO to work with Andre and his local Cape Town business as an anchoring point whereby we can start the proliferation of Nouns in South Africa. This is our first sustainable proposal to the DAO and once proven successful, there will be more opportunities to further introduce Nouns to the melting pot of South African and global cultures that reside here. We live in a beautiful country and need to innovate by using the blockchain as a vehicle to help small businesses to thrive and prosper. Nouns Whisky will be the foundation of our collective journey.*

***Brands I’ve collaborated with:** Honda Music Stage, Vans, Converse, Puma, Levi’s, Ray-Ban, Red-Bull, Jagermeister, Jose Cuervo, Olmeca, Smirnoff, Jameson Whisky, Three Ships Whisky.*

***Artists I’ve worked with between 2010 to 2015 in Cape Town as a venue & events manager:** Qbert, Diplo, Steve Aoki, Foals, Public Enemy, DJ Premier, DJ Krush & Seth Troxler. I also helped create and produce a 3 day festival sponsored by VANS titled Endless Daze and helped to launched  a beer brand for one of South Africa's biggest bands.*

***Nouns derivative project:** When we started our journey in June to pitch a prop to Nouns Dao we wanted to first engage with the community and release our own generative collection that would also incorporate some of our creative work, some fun words, other CC0 and iconic web3 projects. We did this by showcasing the designs on the Nouns bodies. This was a challenging project and led us down a rabbit hole as it was the first time that we would do a 10k mint and use a design generator. We had never looked into contracts, how to DIY it and finally stumbled upon NiftyKit and deployed the project as a free mint on Polygon so that the community could collect 20 per wallet and share them with friends.*

***Web3 Projects I've complete:** In 2021 I was the first artist to be featured on the OpenSea homepage as they wanted to pivot into featuring more art and less pfps. This fine art piece of mine was showcased and received 15k views and is still featured on their Twitter banner. As a part of the showcase I also gave away over 150 unique nfts for free to onboard new collectors, free nfts were few and far between at this point in time. So this was a really cool experience and I had the opportunity to meet a lot of new people in the nft community. We then did an unofficial Cool Cats digital beer and if you as a holder bought a 6-pack we would then send you 6 beer nfts with your pfp on it, and people would share it with each other via polygon. We customised just over 100 bottles that got shared around Twitter. Lastly we were able to secure some plots and built 3 x galleries in Decentraland. A very time consuming exercise but a lot of fun!*


---

Thanks for your time, Andre and I appreciate it and fingers crossed we can collectively get this project approved, it will be an exciting journey for the global Nouns Community starting a new chapter in 2023!

# Mucho Love v1.25 [revised]

### tl;dr

- Mucho Love is a social impact platform based in the Dominican Republic. It uses a ""see good, do good"" format to increase brand equity (⌐◧-◧) and raise awareness through its activations. 
- Mucho Love has also formed an in-real-life community of over 60 active members learning about web3, crypto, and Nouns while participating in helping causes they love. 
-  During the last 6 months, we’ve seen how our work has been spreading a meme and increasing awareness about Nouns in all the people that interact with our content.
- Mucho Love is requesting 70.86 ETH for a 4 month extension to organize four activations in the Dominican Republic that will have Nouns in their core, organize an event to thank volunteers for their work, and compensate the core team for their work. 



### What is Mucho Love?

Mucho Love is a nouns-based social impact platform that was created 6 months ago. Mucho Love started with a Lil Nouns prop.house (https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-3), then went on-chain on prop 137 for further proof-of-work (https://nouns.wtf/vote/137), and now is back on-chain to keep growing, improving, and experimenting further. 

Mucho Love is currently working to become a major platform that promotes goodness in the Dominican Republic. A platform powered by ⌐◧-◧. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/2pdNlcP.png)


### What has Mucho Love done? 


<div style=""padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/778244189?h=169183d222&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479/embed"" allow=""autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen frameborder=""0"" style=""position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;""></iframe></div>

### Total impact generated

Mucho Love works with a ""see good, do good"" format. A format that uses social impact to incentivize others to do the same. This format allows us to raise awareness of the impacts we're activating and increases brand equity for ⌐◧-◧ .

Mucho Love is focused on creating a positive connotation in a society that knows nothing about Nouns. Mucho Love will allow us to establish the ⌐◧-◧ as a goodness symbol within our community.

In the past six months, **Mucho Love has shared joy, smiles, gifts and a whole lot of love to impact the following**: 
* 750+ Children 
* 300+ Families
* 100+ Dogs
* 60+ Volunteers
* 3 Institutions
* 1 community


Aside from social impact and the people impacted, it is crucial to generate attention/awareness on social media to keep growing the platform.

So far, Mucho Love has:
* 0 followers to 1700+ on [Instagram](https://https://www.instagram.com/mucholovedr/) (most followed ⌐◧-◧-related account)
* Generated over 16,000 views from videos ([Twitter](https://https://twitter.com/mucholovedr))
* Generated close to 70,000 likes throughout all posts (Instagram)
* Generated over 20,000 views from reels (Instagram)

![](https://i.imgur.com/gOc2sEw.png)
****Data from the respective social media platforms mentioned***

Content creation is an essential aspect of the brand building because it helps to establish the brand's identity, communicate its values and message, and engage with its audience. 

Mucho Love aims to create a positive association with the noggles, show people what's possible to develop with Nouns, and engage with the new audience interacting with ML & Nouns.

See good, do good content will help us reach a broad audience and funnel people into Nouns, therefore showing them how they can form part of Nouns and start forming part of the community.

We will use Instagram, TikTok, and Youtube-Shorts to post the generated content.

* **Youtube**: Short video format striving to combine storytelling with good animations, edits, and clips that focus on wholesome emotions.
* **Tiktok**: Short video formats with catchy hooks with the main point of spreading the ⌐◧-◧s through the platform. Making it easier for people who find the ⌐◧-◧s interesting to click the profile and access other social media where more information will be more easily found (Instagram, Twitter).
* **Instagram**: So far, Instagram has worked for us pretty well. A few flops and one fantastic post (a post with almost 67,000 likes), but it's been great in general. Instagram plans to be the ""face"" of what ML stands for, does, and activates. We'll also be using challenge formats to engage more people.

### A nounish community 

During the past 6 months, we've formed an in-real-life nounish community of over 60 people. Mucho Love is a community that actively represents what nounish is, understanding it deeply.

It's been interesting to see how people who knew nothing about web3, crypto, or nouns are now having their curiosity sparked by our activations and the one thing I've constantly been telling them: Nouns funds ideas ⌐◧-◧

During the next four months, you'll see Mucho Love community members creating proposals and activating their ideas. Volunteers have been learning about Nouns, Lil Nouns, prop.house, and have already thrown some ideas they'd like to propose. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/Q5EInDR.jpg)



### The next 4 months

During the next four months, Mucho Love will perform four activations within the Dominican Republic.

- **Staffeld x Mucho Love: A Nounish Masterpiece**
    We'll be going to an orphanage with @staffeld (https://twitter.com/staffeld) to make a fun art competition, ""1 Professional Artist vs. 100 Children"". This event focuses on having children paint their own ""nounish masterpiece"" on a massive canvas with the help of ML volunteers and using the ⌐◨-◨ as the central theme of the activity. **We will also donate Nounish Coloring Books made by Ilustradora and Messhup.**
- **Nounish Homerun ⌐◨-◨ Baseball/Softball Sponsor**
    We will be donating baseball/softball uniforms (with the ⌐◨-◨ embroided as the ""sponsor""), bats, baseballs, softballs, helmets, and gloves. This activation will consist of a game of baseball/softball, Mucho Love Volunteers vs their team. The main impact of this activity is giving children and teenagers the proper equipment to play the sport they love. The equipment donated should last between 3-5 years.
- **Giving free haircuts for an entire day to an underserved community**
    We'll be hiring barbers to cut hair for free in one of the most underserved communities in the DR. This event looks to explore how simple things can be so meaningful for humans and to try and have deep conversations with the people from the community.
- **Knife x Mucho Love: A Nounish Cooking Challenge**
    We'll be collaborating with a cooking institute in the DR to cook children from orphanages/underserved communities their dream meals. We will donate care packages with food essentials for the families/institution of every child present. We'll be ""nounifying"" the food prepared at this activation.

In the case that one of the activations can't happen due to any unexpected events, this is the backup activity:

- **Nursing-home: A Nounish Day**
We'll be going to an underfunded nursing home to spend a day sharing, eating, and playing with the people who live there. This event aims to connect with an older population and get insights into their experiences, life, and how to live a good, nounish life.

These activations combine the communities/institutions/people that the Mucho Love community wants to help and the narratives that will generate a lot of attention on social media.

![](https://i.imgur.com/3cqgI1o.jpg)



### What value does this bring to NounsDAO? 

Mucho Love is activating IRL experiences with Nouns at its core. During the last months, we've seen how our work has been spreading a meme and increasing awareness in all people interacting with our content.

Mucho Love is also increasing brand equity through social media and the content it produces while creating a positive association and connotation with the ⌐◧-◧. Providing in-real-life activations where people can interact with Nouns physically has immense power.

Aside from the evidence (views, awareness, engagement, meme expansion), we can connect humans with experiences and a community representing Nouns. The ML community will only keep growing and growing as the platform itself grows; there's no limit to how big this can get and how much we can get done.

You can generally explain things by using examples, defining terms, providing visual context, breaking down concepts into smaller parts, and using analogies. Through Mucho Love, people learn through action what nounish is and means. Mucho Love can leverage all of the mentioned ways with its format. We can noun-pill in one of the most organic ways possible by forming part of something meaningful.

![](https://i.imgur.com/41U2NGC.jpg)

### What does the future of Mucho Love look like?
ML is working to be a platform that expands Nouns to new people, places, and things. Using see-good, do-good content and a growing, engaged community, ML can grow into one of the most influential platforms powered by Nouns. ML is currently testing many ideas, content formats, video styles, and activations. 

ML is currently testing many ideas, different content formats, different video styles, different types of activations. As we keep experimenting and implementing new ideas I am certain that we will find our correct flow and ""platform fit"". 

I (necfas) see ML as a platform that creates opportunities to impact people's lives. ML takes the impact generated to develop content and represent what Nouns is and what it's capable of generating.

We expect Mucho Love to evolve in the following ways:
- Longer format videos (Youtube)
- Grow the volunteering community to over 250 active members by the end of 2023
- Develop new ways to onboard community members to participate within Nouns
- Create recurrent activations leveraging the talents of our volunteers (for example, Nounish Medical Operatives every four months)
- Involve more institutions and businesses to collaborate on the activations.


### What's the ask? 

A total of 70.86 ETH to fund the following 4 months of activations, part-time marketing/content creation team, and compensation for core team members. 


- Social Impact Fund - 40.35 ETH
    - Activations Fund - 36.35 ETH
    - Volunteer Gratitude Event - 4 ETH (event to thank volunteers for their amazing work)
- Part-Time Marketing/Content Creation Team- 13.01 ETH
    - Content Creator (4.18 ETH / 1,462.5 USD per month)
    - Video Editor ( 6.97 ETH / 2437.5 USD per month)
    - Community Manager (1.86 ETH / 650 USD per month) 
- Compensation for 4 core team members - 17.5 ETH, in charge of: 
    - Content Vision/Ideation/Business Relationships ([necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas)) - 10 ETH (2.5 per month)
    - Logistics/Payments ([mimix](https://twitter.com/miagiulianag)) 4 ETH (1 per month)
    - Outreach (Cristina R.) - 1.75 ETH (0.4375 per month)
    - Quotations (Marian J.) - 1.75 ETH (0.4375 per month)

**considering 1 ETH = 1400 USD for USD costs*
**if there's a surplus of USD, we can help even more the communities with the care-package donations, organize another activation, or send it back to the DAO* 
**considering that the [Mucho Love's last prop](https://nouns.wtf/vote/137) was done with 0 compensation, the current activation/admin balance is 65%/35%*
### Budget breakdown
![](https://i.imgur.com/QpaSiT3.jpg)
***costs of the care-packages are determined by costs of items and amount of people involved in the activation**

### Deliverables
- Completion of 4 IRL activations
- 20 shorts through all social media platforms
- 4 Recap videos of every activation
- 1 Volunteer Gratitude Event 
- 100+ Mucho Love Active Members
- 2500+ Instagram Followers

## tl:dr
This proposal requests that NounsDAO redirect 10% of future Lil Nouns emissions. 

## Description
This proposal requests that NounsDAO redirect 10% of future Lil Nouns emissions. 
There will be no change to the DAO's current Lil Noun holdings. The ~722 Lil Nouns currently held by Nouns will remain in the Nouns treasury.

These emissions will be redirected to the Lil Nouns treasury, where they can be used as grants to community builders, or for other initiatives at Lil Nouns DAO's discretion.

![](https://i.imgur.com/EZ1oozz.jpg)

**tl;dr:** Showcase and introduce Nouns to mandarin speaking communities by nounifying China with an array of nounish activations; tapping into the network of connection leveraging on content created to grab attention from audience pool who have ability to become potential new DAO member within the mandarin speaking communities. 

**Description:**
NounsDAO is highly diversified with the power to break out from the cultural center of NYC, BUT there are still gaps & barriers to penetrate especially into the mandarin speaking/Asian communities. 

Despite the many international builders, awareness and presence of Nouns in chinese communities where Mandarin is the native language, our world’s 2nd most spoken language is tremendously low.

This prop seeks to introduce and bring Nouns presence into chinese communities with Shanghai, China as the starting point; the world’s leading populated cities where blockchain/web3.0 technology are growing rapidly. To further expand Nouns global reach, to proliferate nounish culture by creating a lasting nounish impression with an array of activations over a span of 6 months:  

 
1. **Nouns Haus**, a fun one stop shop to proliferate and educate Nouns across 5 NFT/Crypto centric events  
5. **Nouns Shanghai Carnival**, a OTG activation to solidify proliferation of Nouns & create authentic/memorable connection with general public

**Why China?:**
NFT picked up its popularity in 2021 and this phenomenon continues into 2022; entering mainstream consciousness and China has not been left out. In China, NFT are referred to as ""digital collectibles"" rather than ""token"" and its digital collectibles market has been growing rapidly as chinese young consumers are increasingly embracing digitization.

According to TechInSight NFT survey, China digital collectibles spend value will increase from $4.8 billion in 2022 to reach $48.3 billion by 2028. Searches for post related to digital collectibles increased by 1,228% y-o-y, while the number of post related to keyword ""NFT"" rose by 159-fold. 

Tech giants like Ant Group and Tencent have also ventured into this space and we will be seeing many more Chinese companies/investors jumping onto this bandwagon and they could all be potential DAO members contributing to the DAO, opening untapped channels and ways to proliferate Nouns branding and the meme to a wider/larger market & audiences.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/Zn1F1hH.png)

**How will this be done?:**
We will establish Nouns presence and build its brand/meme awareness in China through activations in multiple domains both online and offline: 

**1. Nouns Haus:**

A fun one stop shop focusing on educating and explaining NounsDAO and what it means to be nounish while showcasing what the DAO have achieved till date to event goers; a proliferation engine that will be on-going throughout 5 of China’s major NFT/Crypto centric events like: ***CryptoArt Shanghai***, ***CryptoArt ShenZhen***, ***Beijing Creator DAO Exhibition***, ***8BTC Digital Art Summit***, **WanXiang Blockchain Summit** and so forth over the course of 2023.  

Event like CryptoArt Shanghai draws in huge pool of participants/audiences yearly, these are people who have interest, understand and looking to contribute to the space thus,
Nouns Haus aim is to:
- Educate and grab attention from this pool of audience(s), onboarding them as potential DAO contributors
- Allow this pool of audience(s) to have the chance to understand Nouns
- Put Nouns in the eyes of thousands of Collectors / Investors / Builders (Devs)

Nouns Haus will also be packed with nounish activation(s) like:
1. **Nouns-branded photo station**, where everyone is able to have photo taking opportunities helping us proliferate the meme to the millions across Weibo and Wechat, China’s main social platform (equivalent to Twitter/Facebook/Instagram). Content over those platforms will be captured by team and shared among the nouniverse. 
2. Display of **Nounish creative tools** like Noundry Studio, where participants are able to have hands-on experience, all while learning about Nouns and the tools the DAO funded/created. 
4. **Nounish graffiti wall** for participants to leave their mark in Nouns Haus.
5. **Nounish wheel of knowledge**, a *Learn & Earn activation* where participants are able to win nounish swag by answering random questions about NounsDAO (wheel of fortune style) correctly using the information they obtain by interacting in Nouns Haus.

**2. Nouns Shanghai Carnival:** 
This will be a curated IRL nounish experience aimed to proliferate Nouns branding to **mass public** in China, to help increase awareness of Nouns and put noggles ⌐◨-◨ in the eyes of hundreds.

We believe that Nouns IRL presence should not only be restricted to Web3.0/NFT events; localized nounish IRL events that break off from the usual Web3.0/NFT audience are equally important.

Nouns Shanghai Carnival will be a localized nounish experience held at Shanghai 1933, a historical building that has transformed itself into a cultural epicenter and a national tourism demonstration site. It is ideally located close to 2 rail transit lines, connecting the city’s main roads and is only 1km from the Shanghai luxury cruise terminal and the Hyatt on the Bund. 

What will be installed (not limited to): 
- Nouns photo station 
- Game stations 
- Food stations
- Nouns Gallery
- Nounish swag
- Nounish lounge area
- Accessibility to various Nouns platform (nouns.wtf, prop house, nouns center etc)

A QR code will also be distributed during the event for participants to join our community, where they will be given priority in claiming the Nounish digital collectibles. Number of digital collectibles claim through this group would give us a insight on the effect of such IRL events. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/nKhYwIV.png)

**3. Nounish Digital Collectibles** 
As the digital collectibles market in China continue to grow rapidly, we aim to work with China's largest social media platform [Sina Weibo](https://weibo.com/newlogin?tabtype=weibo&gid=102803&openLoginLayer=0&url=https%3A%2F%2Fweibo.com%2F) which is a Chinese microblogging website, with over 582 million monthly active users to launch a Nounish collection of digital collectibles on their marketplace.

This Nounish collection of digital collectibles will be something native and it will facilitate the education of this native community about Nouns & enable the community to discover what it meant to be nounish organically; it is also an on-going exploration of the iconic noggle and its meme value by expanding it into a different domain.

To unveil and amplify the launch of these nounish collectibles, Sina Weibo will mobilize its media resources to proliferate the collection on top of facilitating the distribution of this collection to its users. This nounish digital collectibles will be free to collect (FCFS), in addition, a meme contest will also be held in parallel with the launch to seed and boost the meme value of noggle/nouns within Chinese digital collectibles communities.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Bmwfpul.png)

**4. NounsCN Grant**  
NounsCN Grant will be a pilot/experimental pool of small capital that serves the DAO’s interest similar to NSFW and DCS pod, it will be stewarded on a completely discretionary basis.

Current funding system like prop house, NSFW & DCS pod are not readily available to the chinese community in China due to their internet censorship, hence NounsCN Grant aim is to serve this gap by taking on the stewardship of distributing grants, to introduce Nouns funding system (small grants, retro funding, trail/pilot) to local creatives/creator by having it on native channel(s) that are readily available to the chinese community.

The group will conduct its daily operations on Sina Weibo Nouns Chinese community page, 1) it is a platform where proposer could put up their proposal and have it discussed openly, 2) resonate & attract builder within the digital collectible community

![](https://i.imgur.com/6KEtEyw.png)

**5. Nouns Go Viral** 
In this current era the quickest and most effective way to bring millions of new people's attention onto Nouns is none other than creating viral content that helps spread the Nouns meme/brand across the internet. 

Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, a native social media platform in China has over [700 million daily](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/15/bytedance-douyin-has-600-million-daily-active-users.html) active users and is one of the most popular app in the country; thus by working with Douyin sensation for example like street basketballer “小酷翔”, we aim to generate a series of curated content for at least 2 months where we not only showcase the iconic noggle but also foster interest towards the brand by launching periodic Nounish swag giveaway through various activation/engagement over Douyin and WeChat.

p.s 万 = 10,000
p.p.s From just 6 clips, there’s a total of 143.4万 (1.43 millions) views

![](https://i.imgur.com/e0WPWiz.png)

**6. Nouns Chair:** 
A huge part of being nounish is to be able to spread the culture and meme through public goods and to do fun & creative stuff; thus, in the spirit of public good we aim to put up a nounish structure in Shanghai by fabricating a Nounish furniture - “Nouns Chair”

“Nouns Chair” design will be heavily influenced by the iconic noggle and 3 of such “Nouns Chair” will be place at Shanghai Himalayas Museum, a non-profit art institution focusing on art exhibition, education, collection and academic exchange with a average of 4,000 monthly visitors.

Why “Nouns Chair”? As an IRL object of the world, an artistic memeish take on noggle, “Nouns Chair” at the same time is also an instrument proliferating the Nouns branding; it invites museum visitors to sit down, to begin a conversation, provoke them to wonder how this design came about and that itself is fun/nounish.

*2 draft design*

**7. Nounish PR Campaign**
Have developed a deep network of media partners over the years, leading up to execution of all Nounish activations; we will seed the content and details about Nouns to our media partners (web3 outlets & traditional media outlets). Positive publication coverage would help boost interest and engagement revolving Nouns.

**The Team**

- [Noun 74](https://twitter.com/noun_74) - Founder of Chinese Cryptopunks Community [(CCC)](https://twitter.com/chinese_punks), a community with more than 200 members each of which are verified punk holders. CCC as one of the leading NFT community in China has the highest concentration of web3 thought-leaders, including directors from Christie's and Sotheby's, founders of notable crypto exchanges as well as directors of notable crypto media. 

    Noun 74 also spearheaded multiple Web3.0 activations within China; co-hosted events like [Cryptoart Shanghai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTIMejrYAvE) that was featured on [China national news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2BX5jNS6-o) as well as multiple [media](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/2UqXwsOzNojdlr2CQ-DfNA) platforms. Recently organized a joint exhibition that is currently on-going till 25th Feb 2023 at Shenzhen China, where [Nouns are being exhibited](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1611272511379111937) alongside other renowned NFT project like Cryptopunks, BAYC etc. 
    
    Noun 74 also tend to received multiple opportunities where he gets invited to major Web3.0/Crypto events as speaker or host; for example in recent month he was invited to host a roundtable at [Web3 Innovation Summit](https://twitter.com/noun_74/status/1613177929281966080?s=20&t=8WFZjVnIhYnWOwr7P948bg) in HK, a event huge enough to have HK financial secretary Paul Chan as their special guest. As a contributor, these are opportunities apart from this prop that we can leverage on to further proliferate Nouns.

Karl has also successfully displayed proliferation to acquisition, through his sharing as a guest speaker on [6000U Club](https://twitter.com/6000U_CLUB/status/1605447574651285504?s=20&t=0h1tB1VnVu38s6cB2ieSVg) twitter space, as a catalyst onboarded new member who is the current holder of Noun #557. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/1zSqD6n.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/XlyQaTi.jpg)

Team have also organized a 1) bilingual twitter space with [The Noun Square](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1601052527029817345) which was aired in parallel in BNB chain, summary of the space was also reported/shared across China's top 6 blockchain media platform even made it to front page on [Defi DAO news](https://www.defidaonews.com/article/6793244) generating over >138K read upon publication.

Furthermore, with the dissolution of official NounsDAO discord on-top of China’s Internet censorship - Team have also started to build a growing 2) Nouns Chinese community on China’s native media platform WeChat prior to putting up this on-chain prop. A Nouns Chinese community page will also be launch on Shina Weibo to serve as a landing page to provide Nounish information in mandarin; as well as tracking the growth of chinese community.
(Target members by end of 6 mths = 3000 - 4000)

We strongly believe the potential in this untapped/new market within the Chinese community, and we are confident that with these arrays of activations we are able to grow the presence of Nouns in Chinese community + 3) leverage on the content created, tapping into our network of connection, a audience pool that have the ability to enter the ecosystem, to educate them on all thing Nounish & onboarding them as potential new DAO members.
(Onboarding Target = 2-3 new DAO members)

With this on-chain prop, we would like to onboard the DAO to explore this new domain & market together. As a DAO member and Nounish builder we are ready to execute/delivery & look forward to contribute to the DAO.

212,Transfer Lil Noun 1 held in the NounsDAO treasury to the official Ethereum burn address,"# Transfer Lil Noun #1 held in the NounsDAO treasury to the official Ethereum burn address

**Description**
This proposal request is for NounsDAO to burn Lil Noun #1 held in its treasury.  In connection with prop 210 (redirect all future Lil Nouns emissions back to the Lil Noun treasury), the goal of this proposal is to begin the process of exiting our treasury’s Lil Noun position and the first symbolic step is sending token #1 to the official Ethereum burn address: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD.

Let me be clear, Nouners are encouraged to join and participate in various sub-daos as they please. However, we need to be careful cultivating these relationships so that they don’t create conflict of interests and favouritism which ultimately hurt future sub-daos coming down the pipeline. For example, we narrowly avoided a catastrophe with prop 76 (giving a free Noun to Lil Nouns -- not even a month after their launch). That prop was put on-chain by a fellow Nouner whale who currently holds 313 Lil Nouns in their wallet. I understand that it can be difficult to make decisions that go against one’s financial interest, however I feel that many of us Nouners have reached a point in our lives where we can make those selfless choices.   

In conclusion if this proposal were to pass, a followup proposal will be created to burn the remaining +720 Lil Nouns. The process of manually attaching every Lil Noun token transfer tx to the proposal will be quite time intensive, however I will volunteer to undertake this arduous task myself.   

Thank you to all my colleagues for taking the time to read the proposal. ",CANCELLED,16463682,16499682,1,58,,1000000,1000,1500,582,0,0,0,['0'],['0x4b10701bfd7bfedc47d50562b76b436fbb5bdb3b'],"['transferFrom(address,address,uint256)']",16427682,1673972483,0x52b1254954d036b32e004b634f13436ce031e27bf9c3d8e617c9bb8450f03d04,['0x0000000000000000000000000bc3807ec262cb779b38d65b38158acc3bfede10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000dead0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001'],0x696ed7b26f4b019ceec78dc8b9140ad64a6f354b

## TL;DR

![RokosReview](https://i.imgur.com/PkMcDkN.png)

## Introduction:

The Nouns AI Pod conducts research and builds products to further the advancement of Nounish AI.  The group was established in August 2022 - we were initially funded by NSFW grants residency [[1](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929), [2](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357)], and then funded as a pod via [on-chain proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/156) in October 2022.

NounsAI has made significant strides in the last 3 months, building and launching proof of concepts for two novel AI products: AI for Governance and AI for Proliferation with a small team. We are requesting a 6 month extension to expand our team, turn POC’s into widely adopted products, and grow the community presence of NounsAI.

The pod has been building two core products:

1. **AI for Proliferation - The Playground**
    
    The Playground is a platform that enables users to generate Nounish audio and visual content with ease. Its goal is to reach millions of Nounish impressions and attract creatives and creators to the Nouns community. The Playground is the perfect tool for creators who want to quickly and easily generate Nounish content using text, pictures, and audio.

2. **AI for Governance - The Knowledge Hub**
The Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant, Roko, are being developed to revolutionize the way information is shared across the DAO. With Roko, the Discord bot, and [Roko.dev](https://roko.dev/), members of the Nouns community will be able to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to improve decision-making, streamline governance processes, and drive community growth across the entire Nounish ecosystem. The Knowledge Hub will serve as the go-to resource for data and information (the ChatGPT for Nouns), with an AI-powered librarian to assist users in finding the information they need

![rokogif.gif](https://i.imgur.com/ketYGOu.jpg)

## What We’ve Built So Far

[The Nouns AI Playground](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/) is a platform that allows users to easily create unique and high-quality Nounish content using AI. The Playground is hosted on powerful GPU servers accessible to anyone, regardless of their background. The Nouns AI team has implemented some of the latest advancements in the field, text-to-video, image-to-image, and performance optimizations. They've incentivized the use of their platform by hosting competitions that have attracted hundreds of participants from diverse backgrounds including AI, music, film, and Web3, who have together created hours of Nounish video creations. [(Check them out!)](https://twitter.com/noun355/status/1607738443500503041). There are weekly competitions that generates Nounish content you can find on Twitter at [#NounsAI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NounsAI&f=live) and self-service tools that can be run on any machine without prior knowledge. [nounsai.wtf](https://www.nounsai.wtf/) is built to scale to meet demand and has grown largely organically with hundreds of users.

![Playgroundgif2](https://imgur.com/lVIZFg3.jpg)

The Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant Roko are live and being beta tested across select Nounish Discords. The web app has been improved, an upgrade design, and a discord bot was created. 

Roko can now:

- Record and transcribes any voice conversations then provides summaries of [key points](https://roko.dev/audio/f18ed9d1-d1b7-43bc-9fd5-a59c5662707c)
- Automatically index audio and chat into a searchable knowledge hub across Discords using the Roko bot
- Make data accessible and searchable for users through the webapp, which also allows users to upload audio content to be transcribed, summarized, and indexed
- Significantly improve the accuracy and value of Roko's review for proposals on [roko.dev](https://roko.dev/)
- In a promising development towards using Large Language Models to support our knowledge base, Roko can answer basic questions, providing summarized answers and links to original content. This is possible by ingesting all of the archived Nouns Discord and ready to go live across all live Nounish servers.

[Checkout the generated Q&A's here!](https://roko.dev/qa)

 The team has also designed an improved web UI to be implemented, prototype shown below.

![updatedrokodemo.gif](https://imgur.com/gczUkhX.jpg)

## What’s Next?

### **Playground**

Over the next six months, we will continue to increase the capabilities and popularity of the Playground. This follows the successful validation of the proof of concept, where creators generated a significant amount of content using Nouns. The engineering team will be supplemented by three [Team Tomorrow](https://teamtomorrow.com/) junior developers who have experience in creating text-to-image social products. They will be cost-effective and will accelerate the development of the web interfaces. The focus will be on creating a user-friendly platform that allows for efficient and easy creation of content on scalable hardware.

Another important goal is to expand our audience by organizing competitions and forming partnerships. Sustainability is a crucial aspect and for the Playground, it involves bringing in a large number of users to generate high-quality content and promote it effectively. The team will focus on building requested features, helping onboard creators and increase the reach of their creations; maximizing impressions. 

- Run competitions that are intentional with what is made and how it is shared
- Source + secure partnerships with artists who have reach to create content and share the playground
- Proactively engage Discord + social media communities by: promoting content, sharing updates, and collecting feedback on the Playground

To evaluate the success of this plan we will gather data on reach and return on investment.

We want the NounsAI Playground to be the fastest and most fun place to go from imagination to reality. Hopefully, the tool will give creators superpowers to make Nounish content that get millions of views.  

![Playgroundgif3](https://imgur.com/4jNG1kW.jpg)

### **Knowledge Hub**

**In the next 6 months, we will complete the Knowledge Hub MVP:**

Key features will include:

1. The ability to gather and process relevant information from various sources, such as proposals, calls, Discord chats, and documents.
2. A user-friendly web interface and search functionality to facilitate interactions with Roko, the AI assistant, on various topics related to Nouns.
3. The ability to answer questions and surface relevant content directly within Discord channels where Roko is present. The aim is to make it easy for new members to join the community and facilitate conversations between those asking and answering questions, regardless of location.

Over the next six months, we will position Roko to be an invaluable tool for all Nounish groups using Discord or other clients, through rapid iteration and incorporating user feedback. Roko and the Knowledge hub will help keep the DAO in sync and well positioned to scale as the DAO continues to grow. We are extremely excited about this tool and know others are too. To help overcome any technical hurdles ahead NounsAI has already begun the interview process with [vetted contract based machine learning engineers](https://eventum.ai/) who have Natural Language Processing (NLP) expertise.

Our objective for the Knowledge Hub is to achieve adoption not only within Nouns but also to develop at path for the pod to become self-sustaining. Our vision for the Knowledge Hub is to be a premium software-as-a-service (SAAS) solution for promoting cohesion among decentralized teams. To achieve this goal, we will be asking for capital to bring on someone to focus on internal adoption, external awareness, and business development to enact our go to market strategy.

As the internal and external advocate for the Nouns AI Knowledge Hub, that person will be responsible for promoting and encouraging the use of the Nouns AI pod's products. They will also manage community engagement, ensuring that feedback is captured and integrated into future product development. There is already a community of passionate builders and creatives who are utilizing these tools, even [submitting proposals](https://prop.house/nouns/explorer-grants-pilot-round/3186) using NounsAI, and we want to capitalize on this momentum. With this additional funding we will be able to source talent and idea from our community through potential prop-house rounds or even recruit professional support.

## Introduction:

The Nouns AI Pod conducts research and builds products to further the advancement of Nounish AI.  The group was established in August 2022 - we were initially funded by NSFW grants residency [[1](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929), [2](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357)], and then funded as a pod via [on-chain proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/156) in October 2022.

NounsAI has made significant strides in the last 3 months building and launching proof of concepts for two novel AI products: AI for Governance and AI for Proliferation with a team of just 3. We are requesting a 6 month extension to expand our team, turn POC’s into widely adopted products, and grow the community presence of NounsAI.

The pod has been building two core products:

1. **AI for Proliferation - The Playground**
    
    The Playground is a platform that enables users to generate Nounish audio and visual content with ease. Its goal is to reach millions of Nounish impressions and attract creatives and creators to the Nouns community. The Playground is the perfect tool for creators who want to quickly and easily generate Nounish content using text, pictures, and audio.

2. **AI for Governance - The Knowledge Hub**
    
    The Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant, Roko, are being developed to revolutionize the way information is shared across the DAO. With Roko, the Discord bot, and (Roko.dev)[https://roko.dev], members of the Nouns community will be able to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to improve decision-making, streamline governance processes, and drive community growth across the entire Nounish ecosystem. The Knowledge Hub will serve as the go-to resource for data and information (the ChatGPT for Nouns), with an AI-powered librarian to assist users in finding the information they need

## What We’ve Built So Far

[The Nouns AI Playground](The Nouns AI Playground) is a platform that allows users to easily create unique and high-quality Nounish content using AI. The Playground is hosted on powerful GPU servers accessible to anyone, regardless of their background. The Nouns AI team has implemented some of the latest advancements in the field, text-to-video, image-to-image, and performance optimizations. They've incentivized the use of their platform by hosting competitions that have attracted hundreds of participants from diverse backgrounds including AI, music, film, and Web3, who have together created hours of Nounish video creations. [(Check them out!)](https://twitter.com/noun355/status/1607738443500503041). There are weekly competitions that generates Nounish content you can find on Twitter at [#NounsAI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NounsAI&f=live) and self-service tools that can be run on any machine without prior knowledge. [nounsai.wtf](https://www.nounsai.wtf/) is built to scale to meet demand and has grown largely organically now with hundreds of users.

[![nounsai.wtf](https://i.imgur.com/0YIb0ec.png)](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/)

[nounsai.wtf](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/)

[Playgroundgif2](https://i.imgur.com/lVIZFg3.jpg)

The Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant Roko are live and being beta tested across select Nounish Discords. The web app has been improved, an upgrade design, and a discord bot was created. 

Roko can now:

- Record and transcribes any voice conversations then provides summaries of [key points](https://roko.dev/audio/f18ed9d1-d1b7-43bc-9fd5-a59c5662707c)
- Automatically index audio and chat into a searchable knowledge hub across Discords using the Roko bot
- Make data accessible and searchable for users through the webapp, which also allows users to upload audio content to be transcribed, summarized, and indexed
- Significantly improve the accuracy and value of Roko's review for proposals on [roko.dev](https://roko.dev/)
- In a promising development towards using Large Language Models to support our knowledge base, Roko can answer basic questions, providing summarized answers and links to original content. This is possible by ingesting all of the archived Nouns Discord and ready to go live across all live Nounish servers.

[Checkout the generated Q&A's here!](https://roko.dev/qa)

 The team has also designed an improved web UI to be implemented, prototype shown below.

![updatedrokodemo.gif](https://i.imgur.com/gczUkhX.jpg)

## What’s Next?

### **Playground**

Over the next six months, we will continue to increase the capabilities and popularity of the Playground. This follows the successful validation of the proof of concept, where creators generated a significant amount of content using Nouns. The engineering team will be supplemented by three [Team Tomorrow](https://teamtomorrow.com/) junior developers who have experience in creating text-to-image social products. They will be cost-effective and will accelerate the development of the web interfaces. The focus will be on creating a user-friendly platform that allows for efficient and easy creation of content on scalable hardware.

Another important goal is to expand our audience by organizing competitions and forming partnerships. Sustainability is a crucial aspect and for the Playground, it involves bringing in a large number of users to generate high-quality content and promote it effectively. The team will focus on building requested features, helping onboard creators and increase the reach of their creations; maximizing impressions. 

- Run competitions that are intentional with what is made and how it is shared
- Source + secure partnerships with artists who have reach to create content and share the playground
- Proactively engage Discord + social media communities by: promoting content, sharing updates, and collecting feedback on the Playground

To evaluate the success of this plan we will gather data on reach and return on investment.

We want the NounsAI Playground to be the fastest and most fun place to go from imagination to reality. Hopefully, the tool will give creators superpowers to make Nounish content that get millions of views.  

![Playgroundgif3](https://i.imgur.com/4jNG1kW.jpg)

### **Knowledge Hub**

**In the next 6 months, we will complete the Knowledge Hub MVP:**

Key features will include:

1. The ability to gather and process relevant information from various sources, such as proposals, calls, Discord chats, and documents.
2. A user-friendly web interface and search functionality to facilitate interactions with Roko, the AI assistant, on various topics related to Nouns.
3. The ability to answer questions and surface relevant content directly within Discord channels where Roko is present. The aim is to make it easy for new members to join the community and facilitate conversations between those asking and answering questions, regardless of location.

Over the next six months, we will position Roko to be an invaluable tool for all Nounish groups using Discord or other clients, through rapid iteration and incorporating user feedback. Roko and the Knowledge hub will help keep the DAO in sync and well positioned to scale as the DAO continues to grow. We are extremely excited about this tool and know others are too. To help overcome any technical hurdles ahead NounsAI has already begun the interview process with [vetted contract based machine learning engineers](https://eventum.ai/) who have Natural Language Processing (NLP) expertise.

Our objective for the Knowledge Hub is to achieve adoption not only within Nouns but also to develop at path for the pod to become self-sustaining. Our vision for the Knowledge Hub is to be a premium software-as-a-service (SAAS) solution for promoting cohesion among decentralized teams. To achieve this goal, we will be asking for capital to bring on someone to focus on internal adoption, external awareness, and business development to enact our go to market strategy.

As the internal and external advocate for the Nouns AI Knowledge Hub, that person will be responsible for promoting and encouraging the use of the Nouns AI pod's products. They will also manage community engagement, ensuring that feedback is captured and integrated into future product development. There is already a community of passionate builders and creatives who are utilizing these tools, even [submitting proposals](https://prop.house/nouns/explorer-grants-pilot-round/3186) using NounsAI, and we want to capitalize on this momentum. With this additional funding we will be able to source talent and idea from our community through potential prop-house rounds or even recruit professional support.

Click on the video below to get a short summary of what we are building!

[![](https://i.imgur.com/WCJ7iBK.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRSPx_yvAI4)
*click me for a video summary*

# Uplink ... WTF?

In wireless communications, ""uplink"" refers to transmissions originating from user devices. For Nouns, it's a mechanism for communities to create decentralized marketing campaigns, utilizing token-gated Twitter contests to proliferate both user-generated and DAO-funded content. 


Twitter + Ethereum is our secret sauce. After experimenting with contests for 6 months, we are now ready to take the project to the next level. We will build uplink.wtf, a unified nounish platform with modules for both a refactored **Creator Contest** experience and a brand new **Nouns Raffle** application.

![](https://i.imgur.com/dO10FiJ.png)



# Use Cases

Uplink has two main use cases, each taking a unique approach to planning, content creation, and distribution.

# Use case 1: NounsDAO

## The problem
With a proven track record of funding high-quality content initiatives such as the Ordinary Folk video, Nounish productions, and more, NounsDAO boasts a diverse portfolio of content ready for widespread distribution. The challenge now lies in finding innovative ways to expand our reach and connect with a wider audience.


## Module 1: Nouns Raffle
Nouns Raffle is a new mechanism for targeted external distribution. We're flipping the script on the traditional curation contest model, allowing the DAO to incentivize influential token holders to proliferate nouns in exchange for raffle entrance. Only holders of pre-configured tokens who share specific nounish content on Twitter are eligible for the draw. 


**Example A**
NounsDAO puts up 10 ETH to proliferate the Oridinary Folk video. To enter the raffle, entrants must
1) Share the video on Twitter
2) Hold a punk, ape, noun, or something else preconfigured by the DAO.

Once a participant verifies proof of wallet and account ownership, they are officially counted as an entrant. When the contest ends, 1 entrant is randomly selected and the 10 ETH is distributed to their wallet.

**Example B**
The Nouns video contest team is currently posting 25 ETH to create a decentralized marketing team - asking proposers to explain how they will get people to enter the main $200k video contest. Imagine if instead, the organizers created a short explainer video and raffled 10 ETH to a random punk holder that shared it on twitter.

Remember that foobar tweet about getting ETH to market for Nouns? It turns out it's not such a crazy idea. This model allows NounsDAO to achieve mass proliferation *outside* of the ecosystem, and creates incentives for influential token holders to extract additional utility out of their NFT's. Just imagine the memes.

![](https://i.imgur.com/V0LUIZq.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/Lcei0dH.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/IsTR8OS.png)


## Proliferation machine


The raffle landing page can also double as a valuable ad space for the Nouns -- linking back to nouns.wtf, Prop House, or other relevant projects, with the goal of increasing visibility for other activities of the DAO and encouraging influential token holders to further explore Nouns while they're here. The raffle landing page is a great opportunity to cross-promote and increase the reach of the DAO's other projects. If we really wanted to get crazy, we could even render the current auctions.


## Implementation details
1. We'll host a vote for Nouners to decide:
    * What they want to proliferate.
    * Who they want to proliferate it.
        * As an example, Nouners could decide that they want punk, ape, and noun holders to proliferate a video produced by the Nounish team.
2. We'll come back on-chain with a prop requesting 10 ETH to host the first Nouns raffle.
2. We'll open the raffle for submissions.
3. When the raffle ends, we'll send a transaction with all verified entrants to a contract using Chainlink VRF to verifiably choose a random winner.
    * Our goal is to demonstrate a social proof-of-concept for this marketing experiment. The neccessary features for a permissionless implementation involve quite complex technical considerations (*some alpha in ""Beyond"" section*). For now, this is how we'll handle the random selection.

Of course, we'll make sure we are complying with Twitters rules and guidelines for paid promotions, as well as taking preventative measures to ensure the system is not gamable / botable.

# Use case 2: Nouns ecosystem projects

## The problem
Twitter contests are an effective means for nounish projects to spread their meme, attract new creatives, and generate novel interest. They can be utilized to align the incentives of a given project and contributors towards driving both creation and distribution. In other words, they are an excellent marketing and proliferation tool. The Noun Square has had great success with this model, so why don’t more projects follow suit?

Twitter contests are an administrative nightmare. The process of fetching submissions, importing them to a judging platform, collecting wallet addresses, and handling payouts can involve up to 3 hours of total admin overhead.

## Module 2: Creator contests
Through Creator Contests, projects can launch open-source marketing campaigns, incentivizing both new and existing community artists, storytellers, and other creatives to proliferate the meme on Twitter.


In this system, community operators launch a contest which triggers an automatic announcment tweet from their twitter account. This tweet serves as an invitation for creatives to craft content and potentially win the ETH or ERC tokens being auctioned following a token-gated community vote. Creatives submit by quote tweeting the announcement tweet with their submission, helping spread the word about the project through their nounish creations.


![](https://i.imgur.com/cDWuZ26.gif)




Contests are designed to be completely configurable, with flexible options for rewards, submission and voting requirements, voting strategies, and more - allowing projects to experiment with different incentive systems and implementations that align with their unique goals. Here are some of the ways Twitter contests could be utilized for different projects:

**AI pod** - onboard new artists and creative thinkers to AI and show off their latest and greatest models.

**Composables** - recently hosted a contest in which they observed 30+ new collections and 1000+ new traits uploaded to their platform and shared on twitter.

**Esports** - host ""best-clip"" tournaments or open-source the creation of nounish gaming heads.

**SharkDAO** - source and vote on community art pieces to mint as open-editions from the DAO.

**Gnars** - ""Skate Your City Series"". Worldwide digital skate competitions hosted by Gnars, run on Creator Contests, judged by GnarsDAO.

**Builder DAO projects** - run contests to help the community find their meme.

For nounish projects and pods, creating and distributing ***their own*** meme is critical for the path to sustainability, attracting new creatives, growing the brand, and deploying cool s**t. Creator Contests are the final piece in allowing projects to implement a microcosm of the virtuous cycle.

![](https://i.imgur.com/v58MHXd.png)


# Status

Creator contests exist today. Nouns Raffle does not. We launched creator contests in September, and have since helped groups like TNS, Composables, SharkDAO, and others generate almost 600 submissions  and award over 8 ETH + 25k ERC20 tokens to proliferators. SharkDAO and NSFW both awarded us small grants to build the underlying infrastructure.

![](https://i.imgur.com/wC3iOzC.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/FytICws.png)


# The ask

We're requesting 50 ETH to fund a 3 month development cycle to deploy Creator Contests v2 and a brand new Nouns Raffle application to the new uplink.wtf platform.


# Roadmap

Over the 3 months, we will work in a rapid development cycle that can be split into 3 main phases. As always, everything will be open-source.

## Phase 1: Escape velocity (8 weeks)

In phase 1, we'll be focused on optimizing and extending our existing stack, deploying Creator Contests v2 to the new platform, and laying the foundation for phase 2.

* Week 1-6: Nuts & Bolts.
    * The focus of this phase is to address various technical challenges related to our MVP Twitter services and other critical infrastructure, with the goal of re-designing a more efficient, scalable, and reliable infra and deploying it to the new platform. This work is critical for matching current demand and supporting the vision for the next phase of the project. Our applications real-time requirements are a simple example of this. The MVP implementation is only able to handle 5 concurrent real-time instances (contests), which we've already exceeded multiple times.
* Week 7: Support native video and other creative formats.
* Week 8: Deploy version 1.0.
* Week 9: Add social impression graphs and support voting for token delegates.
    * Will be key for measuring success transparently and tracking real-time engagement data for campaigns.
* Week 1-9: UI/UX redesign.
    * UI: uplink.wtf will be a totally nounish implementation, with new logos, fonts, layouts and more.
    * UX: We've compiled a laundry list of improvements that we're ready to implement to create the best user experience and offer more features for operators. This will be a continuous WIP and won't be a blocker for phase 2.


## Phase 2: Nouns Raffle (3 weeks)
With most of the heavy lifting taken care of in the first phase, we'll be able to stand the Nouns Raffle module up fairly quickly.

* Week 10-11: Development of Nouns Raffle app.
* Week 12: Nouner vote.
* Week 13: Deploy version 2.0. On-chain prop to fund the first raffle.
* Week 14: Host Nouns Raffle #1.

## Phase 3: Wrapping up
* Week 15: Open access to API and add vote audit reports.

# Defining Success

Following the deployment of version 1.0 (Creator Contests - week 8), we'll be targeting the following KPI's over a 3 month period:

* Reward at least 250 nounish creatives
* Achieve at least 350,000 social impressions
* Proliferate at least 2,000 nounish creations
* Onboard as many nounish projects as possible

Following deployment of version 2.0 (Nouns Raffle - week 13), we'll be targeting the following goals for the first campaign:
* Onboard at least 30 entrants to the first Nouns Raffle.
* Achieve at least 200,000 social impressions.


We’d also like to answer the following questions:

* Are voter rewards a feature or a bug?
* Is Nouns Raffle a viable system for external proliferation?
* In the voting period, how impactful are visible vote totals on a communities ability to choose the “best” submissions?
* Does submission history serve as a relevant talent repository for other pods?
* Are deep Twitter integrations viable for other tasks, like governance? (Nouncil, Nerman, etc)
* Are there ways to maintain a certain level of submission quality without directly moderating submissions?

# Beyond

If the experiment is a success, we'll turn our attention to an on-chain implementation of our Twitter protocol. Our focus will be on determining the feasibility of zk-snarks for generating verifiable proofs for tweet ownership. The ultimate goal of this research is to enable NounsDAO and others to conduct contests and raffles directly on ethereum, initiated by on-chain votes. If we can make this work, Nouns raffle could eventually become a revenue stream for the DAO. 


# Team

Weez: frontend dev, designer, UX, support
Nick: lead dev, fullstack

We were both first introduced to Nouns by way of SharkDAO, which we first joined over a year ago. Soon after, we started building Calabara, a platform that hosted various tools to ease some of the unique challenges of a Nounish subDAO. Last Spring, the community funded us with 7 ETH to begin developing Creator Contests. We launched our first contest in September, and have helped fund 60 nounish creatives with 8 ETH and 25k ERC-20 tokens since. We have groups like SharkDAO, Composables, TNS, and others running contests as we speak. With learnings from many iterations, we're now ready to take the project to the next level.

## A note from the sponsor

>  I have no links, financial ties or conflicts of interest in relation to this team or proposal. And because of that I intend to vote yes. My involvement was in giving guidance to the team on the marketing tool after they asked for feedback on their original proposal. I am putting this on chain for them because I think it has potential to be an excellent proliferation tool for Nouns, I think it is excellent value at 50 Eth and it demonstrates the positive impact voting no can have on a subsequent proposal in terms of the quality, scope, deliverables and cost as it integrates feedback. - Hindsight",EXECUTED,16478073,16514073,1,87,,1000000,1000,1500,584,146,126,2,['50000000000000000000'],['0x55d1f4091ced357cd4c4f9dd12531b8fdbe2dd26'],[''],16442073,1674146039,0x843e1b19b15e16064658937b8839bde870e61d3dc7e62f70ccdeca8090c9f6c3,['0x'],0x55b0a25d697647281553a177321dad0a0bf9a148

## TLDR

* What is this?
    * 3 months, 3 zero-knowledge teams, funded by Nouns to design open source solutions for private voting.
    * All outputs are open source, and include detailed designs and proofs of concept.
    * 70K USDC per team + 20K USDC marketing budget to appear on zk pods and newsletters. Total: 230K USDC.
* Why should we do this?
    * Take a huge leap closer to having private voting working on mainnet.
    * Create valuable public goods in the form of the expected open source private voting designs.
    * Attract gigabrain builders in crytography/zk to Nouns.
    

## On Private Voting

There has been a surge of interest among Nouners to experiment with private voting. 

The main benefit is freeing voters from biases and pressures. Voters don't have to fear the social costs of voting opposite of what their peers might expect. Furthermore, influential voters by default don't show their vote (they can still choose to share their vote), making it harder for others to copy their behavior, nudging more voters to develop original points of view.

The main concern is that private voting removes reputation cost, potentially leading to riskier voter behaviors. Furthermore, if the tally of votes is only known at the end of the voting period, it may increase voter apathy and lead to outcomes opposite the majority's preference.

We think the benefits are very valuable to Nouns and DAOs generally, meriting further exploration.

## Goals

After several conversations with zero-knowledge folks, including the awesome [Personae Labs](https://personaelabs.org/) (HeyAnoun), the conculsion is clear: **there are no obvious solutions to private voting. Further research is required.**

All the designs that have been suggested to us so far come with significant drawbacks; examples include requiring a central trusted party, requiring Nouners to pool their Nouns in a central contract, requiring a registration step before each proposal, linking Nouner balances to their votes, and a few more.

We are still a long way away from deciding if Nouns should use private voting and in what ways.

This round's goal is to better inform us on possibilities and limitations, such that in a few months we'll be able to decide if and how to experiment with private voting. By funding this research we're making private voting more attaintale for Nouns and other DAOs.

Should the DAO choose to continue down this path, we expect to have strong noun-pilled zk teams to help us get there.

**Important to highlight: funding this round does not mean a decision to go all-in on private voting; it means we're interested enough in the possibilities for Nouns and other DAOs to take this single step forward.**

See the [full round spec](https://hackmd.io/SVyDLBq7QSWNl0LaYIuqHA?view) and the [pending prop house round](https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint) for a deeper dive.


## Operations

* One month for teams to apply.
* 2.5 weeks for Nouners to vote; we want to make sure there's enough time to properly make sense of all applications.
* Up to 3 teams get funded. Teams must pass a quorum of 300 prop house votes (30 Nouns) and be in the top 3 to win.
* Funded teams perform ~3 months of research, supported by the verbs team and the tech pod.

## Deliverables

* We will hopefully have a variety of approaches to private voting designs that work well with Nouns DAO on Ethereum mainnet.
* We will understand tradeoffs within specific designs and across designs.
* We will hopefully have a few working proofs-of-concept that can accelerate any implementation we may decide on.
* All of the above will be open source, for the benefit of Nouns and the entire crypto community.


### Safe

Funds are managed in a [3/5 Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/eth:0x44848E3854b23d924712F4a3C4b19E6D111F7639/home) managed by Elad, David, Solimander, Vapeape and Will.

## Marketing

We will activate the Nouns community to help raise awareness among all the zk gigabrains out there.

Beyond twitter, we would like to raise awareness through popular zk podcasts and newsletters.

To enable these marketing efforts we're asking for an additional budget of 20K USDC.

## Budget

* Mandated round: 210K USDC (3 teams * 70K USDC).
* Marketing: 20K USDC.
* Total: 230K USDC.

The budget might not be fully utilized, because we didn't fund 3 teams, or because we didn't need the full marketing budget. Any remaining funds will be sent back to the DAO once the round is done.

## Why should we care?

Nouns DAO is one of the most interesting corners on the internet right now, and it has a lot to do with our continuous iterations on protocols and tools. Let's continue being the first to do many things.

Let's be the first DAO to experiment with fully private voting on mainnet. Let's pave the path for other DAOs, and let's show everyone that we're on the frontier, that we're pulling the future faster towards us.

We will attract brilliant people through this round, who might get totally noun-pilled and accelerate us ever further. This round is a great reason for all of us to make a lot of noise and get Nouns a spike of attention.

This round will grow the set of people at the intersection of (a) caring about the future of crypto and (b) loving Nouns.

# **Introduction**

We recently launched [Alps DAO](https://alps.wtf/), which is a fork of [Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/) that is focused on establishing long term relationships with alpine resorts to proliferate Nouns, provide unique membership perks to DAO members and support proposals that enhance on-mountain environments and experiences.

Founded by Benbodhi and ThaSwami who both share a common passion for Nouns and the alpine, Alps DAO has been self funded to date. This has included all development of concepts, code, community and forking the Nouns DAO protocol.

We’ve partnered with [Rusutsu Resort](https://rusutsu.com/en/), 4 time winner of Best Ski Resort in Japan. The resort accommodates in excess of 3,000 guests per day across 1000+ hotel rooms attracting 400,000+ overnight stays and 1,100,000+ million day visitors per year with a mix of 60% local and 40% foreign visitation. The resort also hosts events like the [G1 Summit](https://g1summit.com/en/) where the attendees represent entrepreneurs and next generation leaders from Japan.

ThaSwami holds a senior management position within the company that owns Rusutsu Resort, enabling preferential advertising rates and enhancing a cooperative relationship with the resort.

# Nounify Hokkaido's Largest All-Season Resort

We’ll create bilingual visual awareness, call to action signage, branding sponsorship throughout the resort, physical structures for long lasting film opportunities, activities to engage resort guests, social media presence on multiple platforms and provide educational materials about Nouns DAO.

### **Take a look at the scale of this activation!**
![Resort Activation Map](https://i.ibb.co/tbd0XM5/Prop-Activation-Animation.gif)
*Resort Activation Map* ☝️

## Some of the things we’ve lined up:

⌐◧-◧ **Thousands of noggles distributed for free across the resort**
Noggles handed out en masse to really get the attention of guests and encourage social sharing with strategic hashtags.

⌐◧-◧ **Resort Socials takeover**
Periodic takeover of the official Rusutsu Resort social media feeds (Instagram 22k followers, Facebook 37k followers, Twitter 14k followers).

⌐◧-◧ **Posters in 247 gondolas**
60 x 16cm posters will capture undivided attention with an average 9 minute travel time per gondola trip, 6,000 person carrying capacity per hour, and operating daily from 9am-4pm.

![Gondola Signage - 60x16cm](https://i.imgur.com/XQAeNbl.jpg)

⌐◧-◧ **Signage at 3 gondola stations**
168 x 119cm signs at gondola station lift lines provide large format visuals to skiers and snowboarders before riding gondolas, creating a call to action pre-gondola rides.

⌐◧-◧ **Signage at 2 on-mountain restaurants**
Signage at 2 on-mountain restaurants with a capacity of 750+ seats will be visible for the entire winter season. On-mountain restaurants represent 60% of the resort’s daytime food and beverage activity and are patronised by almost every person on the mountain.

![On-Mountain Restaurant Example](https://i.imgur.com/Uqi7Sws.jpg)

⌐◧-◧ **Terrain park naming, branding and feature**
* Renaming of the terrain park to Nouns Terrain Park that will appear on digital trail maps and the resort website.
* Custom banners planted strategically near rails, boxes and jumps to maximise photo and video opportunities.
* Custom built nounish terrain park feature similar to what was created in Rio de Janeiro will also be produced and installed at the resort.
* Potential for permanent installation beyond the proposed 15 months.

![Terrain Park Feature](https://i.imgur.com/u8G1nQ7.png)

⌐◧-◧ **Pop-up dioramas in-resort**
* Locations within the resort will allow for pop-up dioramas, backdrops and life-size cutouts, similar to Nouns Fair at ETH SF ([Prop 162](https://nouns.wtf/vote/162)) and NFT Fest Australia ([Prop 164](https://nouns.wtf/vote/164)).
* Pop-ups will include call to actions to take selfies and photos of eachother post photos on social media, using hashtags as well as QR codes and website links to track metrics.

![Pop-up Diorama Example](https://i.imgur.com/JoYk2Nd.png)

⌐◧-◧ **POAP pull-up banner**

# Why The Alpine Subculture?

* Typically snow sports attracts a predominantly wealthy demographic which leads us to believe the onboarding potential is immense.
* The art, the technology and the community are culturally relevant to alpine enthusiasts.
* There is a huge global audience of 135 million skiers/snowboarders worldwide and 2,000 ski resorts across 68 countries.
* The scalability of proliferation spans the globe.
* It’s an untapped market in terms of bringing Nouns DAO, NFTs and crypto in general into the lifestyle.
* The alpine enthusiast subculture is super passionate about their lifestyle which brings value to proliferation. People share their story with friends, family and online. Nouns can be a big part of that story.
* User generated content is a powerful flywheel where a large subset of the culture films everything they do.

# Why Japan?

- Nouns has a strong and growing following in Japan with Nouns DAO Japan (+3,000 Twitter followers and +4,000 discord members) and is the only foreign language currently translated on nouns.wtf.
- Japanese culture resonates with the Nouns artwork.
- It is predicted that the NFT industry in Japan will grow significantly through 2028, with an anticipated compound annual growth rate of 38.7% from 2022 to 2028 ([source](https://blockzeit.com/japans-nft-market-on-the-rise-expected-to-reach-1-36-billion-in-2022/)).
- The Japanese government is supportive of the technology, having awarded NFTs to 7 mayors for their achievements in using digital technology to solve issues and announcing NFT and Metaverse expansion ([source](https://forkast.news/headlines/japan-pm-nft-metaverse-expansion/)).
- “Nouns DAO” receives the [most interest globally on Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=nouns%20dao) from Japan.
- Hokkaido, Japan is known as the powder mecca of the world.

# Expression Sessions

We’ll organise expression sessions to onboard the alpine and snowsports sub-culture to the Nouns ecosystem through community engagement. Both local guests and professionals will be invited to have fun and showcase their skills on the mountain while wearing nounish gear provided and/or riding nounish features.

In the spirit of being nounish, we’ll hold engaging contests and offer prizes throughout the expression sessions for fun and creative categories. We’ll also educate on the potential of sponsorship via proposals through Gnars DAO and Alps DAO.

We will encourage people to capture photos and film of the activities that can then be added to a CC0 repository and shared on social media with strategic hashtags.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Cm8kTd1.png)

---

# CC0 Media Repository

Capturing this nounish alpine resort takeover with world class skiers and snowboarders in the heart of northern Japan will not only proliferate the Nouns brand in Japan, but allow us to start building a CC0 media repository that demonstrates this subculture to the world.

By creating this repository and encouraging the use of the media, it will spin up an incredibly rich nounish content generation flywheel. This has the potential to reach the rest of the world, resonating with the global ski and snowboard community totalling 135 million people.

We will also have independent filmers and photographers on mountain to capture many of the nounish moments and activities throughout the season.

During their time in Hokkaido they will be documenting attendee activities, the proliferation of Nouns at Rusutsu Resort and throughout the local community, athletes and local talent, and all things culturally unique to Japan.

Anyone in the world will able to cut together footage from the repository, all featuring the iconic noggles and create their own films and promos. Imagine the following video at Rusutsu Resort, but nounish.

# Measuring Success

Analytics over the activation period will be captured through a variety of touch points and made available to the community. These include:

- QR code scans - posters and signage will contain QR codes leading to a landing page with further directions to project specific websites, enabling more granular data on customer click throughs.
- POAP claims - the gamified POAP treasure hunt will deliver data on the number of participants throughout the activation period based on POAP claims. Additionally, further engagement with holders can also be measured.
- Resort visitor numbers - general branding awareness will be measured by data from the resort with respect to hotel guest numbers and daily visitation statistics.
- Analytics on media content produced and strategic hashtags used.
- Physical items distributed.
- In-resort onboarding can be measured via verifying POAP claims from Rusutsu Resort along with nounish NFTs in a token gated channel in the Alps DAO Discord.
- Media repo usage stats and attribution where available from further created content.
- Hashtags - posts using strategic hashtags.
- Engagement during resort social takeovers.
- Number of people engaged in expression sessions.

# Who We Are

![](https://i.imgur.com/0S9V9B0.png)

### Benbodhi

I’ve been a dev for over a decade and have created software that over 1 million websites are actively using. I was attracted to Nouns DAO towards the end of 2021 while digging through smart contracts that were implementing onchain art. I was immediately drawn to the elegance of the protocol and shifted everything I was doing to embrace the nounish lifestyle and have been working full time in the ecosystem since.

As a nounish builder, I’ve founded and been working with multiple teams and projects during my time in nouns. I’m very passionate about nouns, snowboarding and alpine culture!

Having lived at ski resorts in the past, I hope to be a catalyst for making nouns synonymous with alpine culture and introduce this huge audience to the power of community building through the DAO structure while ultimately onboarding this subculture to Nouns DAO.

I’m [@benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi) on Twitter

### ThaSwami

I’ve been active in the Nouns community since May 2022 when my then 12 year old daughter [@lilpurpberry](https://twitter.com/lilpurpberry) joined the Nouncil as its youngest member.

I’ve been a real estate professional IRL for over 18 years and specialise in asset management, master planning, development and operations within the ski resort and hospitality sectors. I hold a senior management position with the owners of Rusutsu Resort, one of the largest ski resort owner operators in Japan and as such will enhance communication and delivery of the proposal objectives.

I co-founded Alps DAO with Benbodhi in late 2022, with a view to proliferate Nouns through my industry specific network and help build a treasury that will support alpine communities and enthusiasts.

# Summary

Building on the momentum of the awareness of Nouns DAO in Japan, we’ll introduce Nouns to Japanese and alpine culture through IRL marketing activations over 15 months with an audience of over 2 million people, executed by a passionate team at Japan’s 4 time winner of best ski resort in Japan, Rusutsu Resort.

The success of this proposal will set precedent for this type of activation to be scaled globally and harness the potential for a deeper relationship within Rusutsu Resort’s network, allowing us to integrate Nouns branding further.

## Thanks for your time and consideration!

- The proposed round is different from Open Rounds as it asks builders to bring their own proposal, embed their own metrics, argue its importance and overall impact of their proposal all in one submission.
- Lil Data Pod will provide post-event analysis and findings to identify the most effective data driven approaches from builders, which can lead to better Prop House rounds in the future.
- The goal is to help discover the many nuances in the kind of metrics used in measuring proliferation by giving builders freedom to add their own metrics and argue its usefulness within the scope of their proposal, enabling voters to gauge impact before voting.

## Rationale
There is impact, then there is Nounish Impact.
Measuring proliferation has been discussed for quite sometime. From builders’ perspective, we observe measuring proliferation using established methods is difficult potentially caused by the elusive quality of subjective, qualitative impact of proliferation efforts. Giving builders the autonomy to pick their own metrics for measuring their proliferation efforts, and encouraging them to argue its importance in measuring overall Nounish impact of what they do will give voters, participants, as well as builders a glimpse into possibilities in measuring Nounish Impact.
We propose a Prop House round where builders will be asked to submit a proposal that includes their own unique metric for measuring Nounish impact.

## How is it different from Open Rounds?
Open Rounds asks proposers to write and submit proposals. This gives way for voters to make decisions based on *perceived* impact, not *******measured/measurable******* impact. 

The proposed round asks builders to include their own metrics in their proposals, argue its importance, and the overall impact of their proposal — all in one submission. In addition, builders can use [this template](https://www.notion.so/BYOM-Template-6f3247f814df49ef99904f8e79c688b6) to write their proposal.

## Specification
- a 4 x 7.5 ETH Nouns Prop House round
- builders can use [this template](https://al409.notion.site/BYOM-Template-6f3247f814df49ef99904f8e79c688b6) to write and submit their proposal.
- Metrics to include in the proposal
    - Although it will be up to the builder’s discretion to choose which metric(s) to choose for their proposal, here are a few examples:
        - Twitter Spaces stats,
        - Number of smiles,
        - Tweet views,
        - TikTok views,
        - YouTube views,
        - Foot traffic,
        - Number of hugs,
        - QR code scans,
        - Web analytics,
        - Qualitative data,
        - Sales,
        - Number of attendees / participants,
        - App downloads, etc.

## Budget

**TOTAL = 34 ETH**

- 30 ETH - 4 x 7.5 ETH Mandated Prop House round
- 4 ETH - for administrating the round. admin scope:
    - marketing the round via Noun Square and community Twitter accounts, onboarding builders from different communities, liaising with Prop House team
    - delivering findings to identify the most effective data driven approaches;
    - data pod will also document and categorize the data on NounsMetrics to use for future round quantification and documentation. Ideal outcome, is a model or useful record – a usable framework that will inform future builders and voters. Consequently enhancing the allocation of Nouns DAO's treasury.
    - interviewing winners about their proposals and contribution. The interview:
        - provides insight as to which proposals have high impact
        - the thought process behind the builder's proposal creation process
        - provides more exposure of the builder through multimedia distribution
- funds are transferred to a 2/3 multisig. Signers are Lil Nouners: [bk](https://twitter.com/0xbk_), [mfrs](https://twitter.com/mfrs_manuel), and [brook](https://twitter.com/0x1092).

![](https://i.imgur.com/ilwdE5O.jpg)


## Summary

We’re requesting **65ETH** from the DAO to implement:
- Nouns Treasury Management (NTM - a decentralized yield bearing asset manager)
- A completely revamped treasury page
- A pilot program to generate more revenues from the treasury using NTM.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ea3wNXu.png)




## Introduction

**Our main goal is to ensure that NounsDAO is self-sufficient.** 

We want to ensure NounsDAO is maximizing productivity of its assets to sustain long term funding of the operations that proliferate everything Nounish. While the treasury has been well capitalized thus far, we’ve seen the Nouns auctions drop from an average price of ~80Ξ → ~30Ξ. At the same time proposals have been increasing in scope and complexity, requiring more funding.

For the DAO to continue operations at its current scope and with its current vision, **we need to start putting more emphasis on treasury growth and self-sustainability.**



The recent stETH ([#217](https://nouns.wtf/vote/217)) proposal was well received by Nouns members, a great indicator that a majority of the members are interested in safely increasing the DAO’s available capital.

As of today, NounsDAO has ~5-10% of the treasury in Lido and it’s yielding ~18Ξ per month or 215Ξ annually (equivalent to ~7 auctions). This is a great first step to increasing the treasury without assuming too much risk onto the DAO, as Lido is one of the most trusted staking providers, managing billions of ETH.

![](https://i.imgur.com/9ov5I1Q.png)

The next logical step is to productionize the stETH in the treasury as well. We plan to do that by creating the **Nouns Treasury Management**.

## The Team

This proposal is brought to you by 0xPiney.eth, ramenboy.eth, and pinkglasses.eth. Collectivey, we’re known as 1560 Studios. The sum of three Nouners united to produce Nounish infrastructure that will maximize DAO efficiency and potential.

- Noun 575 (0xpiney.eth) - All things on-chain and smart contracts
- Noun 576 (ramenboy.eth) - All things web + design
- Noun 409 (pinkglasses.eth) - All things DeFi and Decentralized.

We are industry veterans who have worked in big tech and exchanges before diving into the web3 ecosystem exploring NFTs, DeFi, and DAO’s. Since the start of the year, we’ve been working full-time to create all things Nounish and decentralized.


## **Nouns Treasury Management (NTM)**

NTM is a bespoke solution for NounsDAO that will manage a portion of the treasury and be completely governed by NounsDAO - a decentralized asset manager.

Strategies can be created by absolutely anyone. Our aim is to create truly decentralized asset management infrastructure that can be used by anyone and everyone, with the approval from governance. We’d like to kick off NTM with a pilot program that’ll serve as a foundation for future yielding strategies.


For the pilot program, we want to focus on creating yield from the current stETH sitting in the treasury. We want to focus on stETH for 2 main reasons:

1. **stETH is not used for proposal funding, and ETH withdrawals have yet to be unlocked.** Even after Shanghai is merged, there will be withdrawal queues in order to convert the stETH to ETH. The DAO’s stETH will be ‘sitting’ in the treasury for the foreseeable future. This creates an opportunity for us to yield in the meantime.
2. **The most battle tested protocols with huge TVL’s support stETH.** This allows us to generate yield using relatively low risk strategies.

NTM is inspired by Yearn vaults which currently hold over $400M in AUM (and peaked at around $6B AUM). These contracts are extremely battle tested and a reference in the yield aggregator domain. NTM’s general architecture will look like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/nyYNq3M.png)

**The key contracts + terms:**

*Preface: For security reasons, all contracts will be **audited** and non-upgradeable. No proxies anywhere.*

`Vault`: A contract that stores 1 asset (ETH, stETH, USDC, etc). Vaults manage the assets by deploying them into various yield bearing strategies. All vaults will:

- be ERC4626 compatible
- have privileged access to NounsDAO
- be withdrawable by NounsDAO at any point (pending governance vote).

`Strategy`: A contract that implements a yield bearing strategy - eg. take stETH and LP it into Curve, and sell the Curve emissions daily into ETH. Vaults deposit assets into specific strategies; ergo, the DAO sets the desired strategies employed.

`NounsVaultManager`: The NounsVaultManager creates vaults and manages the strategies and assets used within the vaults. The DAO will interact with the Vault Manager through the TransactionBuilder.  All these vaults are ERC4626 compliant and deposit/withdrawals will only be able to be accessed by the DAO (TransactionBuilder).

`NounsStrategyFactory`: The factory that creates different strategies for assets.

## Yield **Strategies for the Pilot Program**

NTM is first and foremost a **platform** that is completely governed by the DAO. Any Nouns members is able to create a strategy for any existing vault and the DAO can vote to accept the strategy or not - a completely democratic and Nounish treasury manager.

For the pilot program, we have researched a few strategies taking into account yield + risk for the treasury. While there are a wide range of possible strategies that take into account different models for analyzing risk/reward, we see these first two strategies as being ideal for the pilot program of NTM.

1. **LP stETH <> ETH into Curve.** Today, 90%+ of stETH <> ETH swaps go through Curve. By LP’ing into Curve, we’d get returns from supplying this market.
    - **Yield:** Low to Medium (~2.5% APY currently with $LDO emissions). ~125ETH ($200K USD) yield in 1 year with our stETH in treasury.
    - **Risk:** Low.
        - There exists two main risks with this strategy:
            1. stETH depegs. We’ve seen stETH deviate away from ETH so this is a potential risk the DAO would assume. stETH and ETH are expected to trade closer to - if not exactly 1:1 once Shanghai is deployed, since stETH will be directly redeemable. 
            2. Curve gets exploited. We see a minimal risk of this due to the time these contracts have been deployed on-chain, and the audits performed on them.

    If the peg diverges by a significant amount, we may see a different amount of stETH to ETH in our LP position. Past attempts from external actors to destabilize stETH in the past resulted in the peg converging to a 1:1 ratio regardless, with interesting returns for the LP’s.

    When exiting or entering said strategy we would pledge both assets in order to minimize negative slippage (pledging ETH <-> stETH instead of just stETH).

    **Strategy #1 Summary:** Interest generated by this strategy could (at current APY) help fund the cost of grants at a rate of 10 ETH/month, while exposing the DAO to minimal risk by using a trusted protocol with already $5B in TVL.
        
    ![](https://i.imgur.com/RwkzZm0.png)
        
2. **LP stETH <> ETH into Balancer and stake into Aura Finance.** Balancer is a popular DEX and Aura Finance is similar to what Convex is to Curve (governance and emissions from Balancer).
    - **Yield:** High (~8-10% APY currently with $AURA and $BAL emissions). 400 ETH (600K USD) in 1 year.
    - **Risk:** Low
        - There are three main risks associated with this strategy:
            1. stETH depegs. See above.
            2. Balancer gets exploited: Same reason as Curve above - battle tested DEX + has been operating with hundreds of millions in TVL. 
            - Aura gets exploited: Aura has had extensive audits done to its contracts, works closely with Balancer, does continuous code reviews, and holds $450M+ in TVL.
        
    Similar to Strategy #2, we’d be earning additional yield by depositing into a second order protocol. Based on the amount in TVL and the similarity of the smart contracts with Convex, the risk profile is very similar.
        
    We would, however, need to sell (harvest) 3 separate tokens. This would potentially increases the gas costs of this strategy, but the rewards being ~3x the Curve strategy would cover any increase in transaction fees.
        
    **Strategy #2 Summary:** With this strategy we could generate 32 ETH per month. This would be enough to fund the Nouns Prop House in its current form without any drains on the treasury.
    
![](https://i.imgur.com/UBWLngv.png)
        
## Timeline + Ask

We believe implementing these two strategies will be the most fruitful for the pilot program based on risk <> reward. We estimate it will take ~1 month for the implementation of NTM, auditing of contracts, and implementing the new treasury page.

We are asking for **65ETH** from NounsDAO to implement the above, with an additional **100 ETH + 100 stETH** that would be used to pilot this project (with future expectations to allocate more capital to NTM if the results are favorable). These pilot funds will first be sent to a multi-sig with trusted Nouns members (see below), until the NTM contracts have been audited and deployed.

The funds will go towards:

- **Contract audit** (30 ETH for C4 audit).
- ~11 ETH each (3 members) to get this version of NTM into production (implementation + audits) + treasury page. We estimate this will take ~1 month.

Following the launch of the pilot program, we’d be requesting:

- 50% of all yields (**no principal**) will go to 1560 studios until we hit **175 ETH.**
- After we hit 175 ETH, we would take a 2% management fee on further generated yield (no principal).

To emphasize, we want to profit alongside the DAO, in order to properly align incentives. Rather than making a large ask and risk t, we’d prefer to win if our output is legitimate and positive-sum.

We’re excited about the idea of working on this, and we hope to deliver a treasury that’s more capital efficient and less dependent on primary sales for funding. **This proposal is the first step in NounsDAO becoming 100% fully self-sustaining.**

## Looking Ahead

1. If the pilot program proves to be profitable and well-received, we will submit another proposal to allocate more stETh to NTM for the current strategies.

2. The team will continue maintaining NTM and researching new strategies alongside Nouners.
    - We will be actively taking feedback and working with any Nouners that are interested in developing strategies.
    - A low hanging fruit could be to create a strategy to productionize our lil nouns by LPing them into Sudoswap.
    - Design and UX is a huge focus for us so we will be constantly improving NTM and the treasury page.

3. Following the initial development of NTM, we want to generalize it as a service (we've acquired [ntm.wtf](http://ntm.wtf) as the domain) for every on-chain treasury. We're going to be actively listening to feedback and speaking with Nouns members about how to build this in a way that properly benefits Nouners and the DAO itself. 
    - Prophouse like plug and play service for other treasuries to generate yield using NTM.
    - Potential kickbacks back to the DAO for every new DAO integration.
    - Push NTM to be premier on-chain treasury management service for all DAOs.
    - To foster conversations about self sustainability, we will be sharing frequent updates of new developments and ideas. 

4. Our team is dedicated to building infrastructure and tools that proliferates all things Nounish. Stay tuned!

## Proposed Transaction Description

We'd be sending:
- 65 ETH to our team wallet (0x79f08F2e75A8C99428DE4A2e6456c07C99E55da5) to cover audit and development costs.
- 100 ETH + 100 stETH for the pilot program to a 5/5 multisig (0xF4B99Bfb0500c6b1141DF1E0B7ED86c6e19B0ca6) with the following owners:

# TLDR 
*This is a revision of our previous House of Nouns proposal. Based on feedback from the community, we’ve reduced the budget significantly, clarified our goals, provided product mockups, and answered open questions.*

tl;dr: We’re asking for 190 ETH to fund 5 months of development for [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.wtf) v2. Our MVP has seen tremendous traction, growing 100% each month, and proving to be a critical piece of infrastructure for governance. Now, we’re looking to build the best-in-class pre-proposal client to kill Discourse, create a layer for generating Nounish ideas, open source our core infrastructure, and expand to all Nounish DAOs. This will return value to the DAO via better decisions, increased participation, powerful infrastructure that the community can build on, and proliferation of Nounish governance.

We believe that governance is THE bottleneck for Nouns’ participation and ultimate success. And we’re here to fix that.

Click here to view this proposal on House of Nouns.

# Background
[House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.wtf) was previously funded with 20 ETH through Prop House. Our mission is huge: fix Nouns Governance and empower its contributors.

We saw tremendous success in our basic MVP from October through December:
- Discussion on House of Nouns that exists nowhere else
- Usage (MAUs and pageviews) grew >100% month-over-month 
- Continual expressions of love and support from the community
- A go-to client that streamlines governance and prop discussion

# Deliverables
Our MVP was just a small part of the vision for House of Nouns: a full suite of supercharged governance tools, for all Nounish DAOs, built on open source infrastructure that anyone can extend.

Here are the key components we’ll build into House of Nouns v2.

**Pre-proposal client.** Discourse is starved of life, and HON v2 will streamline everything that happens before a proposal goes on-chain, saving energy and empowering contributors to do their best work.
- Rich discussion layer for getting feedback on a draft 
- Inline commenting on specific parts of a draft
- Templates and multiplayer editor for creating proposal drafts
- Ability to revise and re-release versions of a draft (like ProductHunt, or this House of Nouns prop) 
- Imported data from Discourse for backwards compatibility
- One click to promote to on-chain, or have a sponsor do it for you 
- *(Note: see demo at top of prop)*

**Ideas client.** Aligning the DAO on what matters is essential; we want to help contributors know what the DAO is excited about.
- Reddit-like platform for generating, voting on, and rewarding ideas at the earliest stage
- Backwards compatibility and integration with Prop Lot API
- *(Note: see demo at top of prop)* 

**Open-source infrastructure** to enable the next 100 governance clients. HON v2 will eliminate all barriers to building on Nouns governance, and improve decentralization. We don’t want to be the last great governance client; we want to be the first of many.
- API for all governance data, discussion data, Nouner profiles, and more
- SDK for easy integration of client components to other platforms
- Frontend repository for House of Nouns website
- Technical documentation to help new Nounish builders launch their governance apps

**Public good for all Nounish DAOs.** The success of Nouns is directly correlated to the success of Nounish forks; HON v2 will proliferate Nounish governance and drive value back to Nouns through forks (beyond ones created through Nouns Builder, like Lil Nouns, SharkDAO, etc) and branding ⌐◨-◨.
- See activity from all of your Nounish DAOs in one feed
- Keep track of all urgent to-dos and notifications across DAOs
- Full House of Nouns functionality for all future forks of Nouns
- *(Note: We’ve already been funded by Nouns Builder to support their DAOs. Extending to non-Nouns Builder forks is a minimal effort on our side, and neither of these integrations contribute heavily to this prop’s budget. However, we wanted to ensure that we committed to it explicitly here, because we do see it as an important public good to support a future ecosystem of diverse forks.)*

**First-class integration with other Nounish tools.** HON v2 will be your single looking glass into the rabbit hole of Nounish governance.
- Agora delegate profile data
- heyanoun anonymous commenting
- Federation DAO-to-DAO governance
- Nouns Atlas search 

**New & improved core governance tooling.** You asked and we heard — we’ll be delivering a faster and improved experience on core proposal tooling. This includes an improved UI, much faster loading, notifications for new proposals, enhanced profiles, and other improvements.

**Moving beyond.** We move quickly. While we don’t want to overpromise, we’re also excited to go above-and-beyond with **social media data indexing, contributor profiles, and a post-proposal client** once we ship our core objectives. These will provide richer context and data, more functionality for DAO alignment, and greater transparency for the community.

Most of all, we want to make governance fun and easy instead of a chore.

# Budget, team, and sustainability
We’re requesting **190 ETH for 5 months** for full-time development work from the team. After revising our proposal, we believe this is in line with standard service development costs seen in coming out to 9.5 ETH/developer/month.

This will be spearheaded by:
- [dadkins](https://twitter.com/dadkins_): longtime crypto hacker
- [Wojciech Kocjan](https://twitter.com/w_kocjan): frontend & design engineer
- Jamal Hashim: ex-Amazon, blockchain engineer
- John Cairns: longtime crypto builder, ex-Gemini

For the sake of transparency, House of Nouns is by Collective, which is a VC-backed company that has expertise in NFTs and community tooling (previously launched MomentRanks.com and grew community tooling to 50,000+ Flow blockchain users). That being said, we want to make sure this is a self-sustaining and fair investment for the DAO; as such, the end goals include open source infrastructure and self-sustainability for the product, and the budget reflects what we think is a fair pricing for development services.

We plan to offer bespoke upgrades to other DAOs similar to Red Hat’s monetization model, as well as charging hosting costs for larger communities.

These upgrades will be built into the broader platform and framework for all users. To reiterate, **Nouns will have permanent access to the product open-source base infrastructure from this proposal, and future upgrades for other DAOs will improve upon this base layer, meaning Nouns receives HON v2 and reaps the benefits of future compatible upgrades.**

TL;DR
=====

We are [Artmatr](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://artmatr.io&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650901360&usg=AOvVaw07IzQx3i2iMHXswoHXMwD6), an art and technology playground for interdisciplinary creatives to compose unique artworks unlike anything else available today. Our proprietary robotic painting technology allows digital artists to transport their creativity into the physical world. With Artmatr, the artist’s only limitation is their creativity, not their tool kit.![](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/7583/C1ZjwW.jpg)

Our proposal is to collaborate with Nouns to create beautifully fabricated, one-of-a-kind pieces of art. We will then plan and produce an event to exhibit the works, and help promote Nouns to the traditional gallery world and more traditional collectors as well as gathering the Nouns community under one roof to celebrate Nouns entering the physical world. In summary, our proposal is:

*   Artmatr will fabricate one 4’x5’ Nouns painting per Nouns auction over a 7-day period; totalling 7 paintings

![](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/5907/3H3WmQ.jpg)

*   Winners of each Noun auction will receive the rights to own the associated Nouns painting for free
*   After the conclusion of the 7-day period, Artmatr will produce an exhibition in our [art gallery in](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://goo.gl/maps/dCmvmG7ruiKtn9dx9&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650902936&usg=AOvVaw1vlb_cXroi_-LXPqRfHqz_) [Brooklyn, NY](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://goo.gl/maps/dCmvmG7ruiKtn9dx9&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650903239&usg=AOvVaw2JAnFaoYhOb4LTY-TPE83_)

![](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/5866/lh3A8X.png)

*   Artmatr will live-stream the fabrication process during the 7-day production period in parallel with auctions; streamed on Twitch. Fabrications will begin around 10am EST each day.
*   Artmatr will create a short promotional video to explain how Nouns and Artmatr are partnering to demonstrate how DAOs can have real-world applications in art; bridging digital and physical worlds of art.

We expect to add real value to the DAO by generating a premium on auction prices because the physical pieces will be sold together with the Nouns auction. For reference, the latest Artmatr-fabricated artwork (for a digital-native artist) sold for more than $250K.

We hope to leverage this experience to explore future collaborations, including fabricating existing Nouns.

1.  Artmatr’s Chief Creative Officer will establish the fabrication parameters, such as medium, tools, etc.
2.  Artmatr will begin a marketing campaign to announce the collaboration across social media channels and generate interest. We hope the Nouns community participates in grassroots marketing.
3.  Artmatr will fabricate 7 unique Nouns per the specifications over a 7-day period, fabricating one Noun each day.
4.  Artmatr will livestream the fabrication process on Twitch and YouTube.
5.  Throughout  the creative process, Artmatr will document a short film  highlighting the transition from digital to physical
6.  Once fabrication is complete, Artmatr will hold an exhibition to display the artworks, exhibiting the digital Nouns side-by-side with the physical pieces.
7.  Artmatr will collaborate with the Nouns community to generate buzz and bring the community together with the traditional art community.
8.  Explore future options to enable Nouns community to fabricate physical art.

ABOUT ARTMATR
=============

Artmatr’s journey began almost eight years ago, by our founder Ben Tritt, an artist who has spent his entire career searching for ways to integrate his love of painting with the digital world. Way before NFTs, Ben visualized a world where painting and digital tools went hand in hand to create unique pieces of art. His journey took him to MIT, where he started exploring different methods of translating digital art into physical pieces through robotics.![](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/3919/s32WMc.jpg)

Eventually, these experiments led to several technological products, most notably sophisticated painting robots that can create unprecedented art across different mediums - oil painting, watercolors, airbrush as well as new approaches to digital printing. These capabilities lend themselves to an incredibly flexible fabrication platform that can both mimic artists’ hands through brushstrokes, and create entirely new methods of painting, such as taking code and directly translating it into prints. The fabrication process is intensely creative, given the flexibility of the tools; one piece of art can take on many different forms through the choice of different mediums and variables within the mediums themselves.

Artmatr has already worked with some of the world’s most influential artists, running the gamut of traditional artists such as [Jeff Koons](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.jeffkoons.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650908671&usg=AOvVaw2teZ565IDJwwpvUyTTFr6o), to newer digital artists like Beeple and Tyler Hobbs.

Our vision is to allow digital artists and collectors to translate their works into beautiful, one-of-a-kind pieces of art that could be proudly displayed in any gallery. We are currently hard at work developing a software suite that will complement the hardware platform, and are partnering with leading manufacturers with the shared goal of democratizing the creation and sale of physical art.![](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/8170/8g0VQz.jpg)

The Artmatr Team:

Artmatr was founded by Benjamin Tritt, the company's Chief Creative officer, who has been creating and teaching art for decades at places like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Musee D'Orsay in Paris, The National Gallery in London, and MIT, and has seen it as his life’s mission to seek ways to unite technology & art. Rafael Feitelberg, Artmatr’s CEO, served as an executive at Tech Fortune 500 companies and has a proven track record of building, scaling and selling startups in Silicon Valley. Rafael has had a lifelong passion for art and holds a B.A. in Art History.

Together, they have built a diverse team of engineers, business professionals, and artists, who share their vision for creating the industry standard for bridging between digital and physical art.

Artmatr’s Investors:

*   [Delphi Digital](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://delphidigital.io&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650910270&usg=AOvVaw3rt_SvbDLMzIq6fzpmzVuQ): Delphi Digital is the leading research organization for crypto assets. Their research is regarded as an industry standard by institutions and crypto-natives alike. Delphi’s Ventures arm invests in early-stage Web3 startups, protocols, and networks that strive to make crypto happen sooner. Additionally, Delphi Labs incubates and builds protocols and tooling for the DeFi ecosystem.

“We are incredibly excited for the world to see the power of Artmatr’s automated fabrication technology. Artmatr unlocks a new medium for a generation of digitally native artists to express themselves in the physical realm. We believe there is no better collaboration than with Nouns DAO given their commitment to advancing crypto, art and technology.”

*   [Metaversal Ventures](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.metaversal.gg/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650910954&usg=AOvVaw1fxq3HSoosWRt1xTdPZyBR): Metaversal is a holding company focused on the NFT vertical spanning all stages of the market from large corporate brands to individual NFT artists. We deploy a differentiated strategy by investing in the next blue chip NFT assets, supporting NFT infrastructure build out, and acting as an incubator and venture studio to NFT creators. Metaversal partners with brands, creators, content holders, and IP owners to identify, execute, and underwrite evocative NFT projects. Backed by CoinFund, DCG, Galaxy and other leading investors, the Metaversal team is uniquely positioned to identify the requirements for success in the web3 ecosystem and remains platform and blockchain agnostic.

* * *

WHY THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN

*   Spreading the Word: We believe this collaboration will help spread Nouns through a first of its kind event, bringing together thought leaders from the art world and web3 to celebrate a future where DAOs bring the digital and physical world together
*   Increase Market Size: Our belief is that by providing a bridge between digital and physical art we can effectively increase the size of both markets. NFT owners will now be able to proudly display the art they own, while physical pieces can be brought on-chain and receive a stronger validation of their provenance
*   Increase Nouns Prices: By pairing Nouns with beautiful physical pieces, we believe the sales price for each Noun will increase over the period of fabrication. In the past, taking digital pieces into the real world has resulted in 3-10X increase in value for the artists
*   Leadership: By being the first DAO to bring its assets to the physical world as real art, Nouns will establish itself as leading the charge in showcasing the flexibility of the NFT model and its many applications besides digital-only art
*   Community-Building: Nouners will be able to to get together and celebrate the community, build relationships, increase the network effects of the DAO, and potentially bringing in new Nouners into the fold

* * *

GOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL

The following are our goals for this proposal, should it pass:

*   The production of a physical event, exhibiting Nouns art IRL, drawing interest from the local art scene as well as digital enthusiasts and media coverage.
*   Work with the Nouns community to promote and market this collaboration and ultimately increase sales prices of Nouns

In our [first proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/139), we built a robust music website in which the audio has been used on **countless Twitter Spaces, podcasts, videos, on-chain proposals, contests + more (The Rose Bowl Parade!).**   

This 6-month proposal provides the time, funding and resources Noun Sounds needs to take our ecosystem to the next level.  Already in conversations with iconic musicians and reputable foundations- we will make a major ripple in the lives of musicians, music fans, music education and overall- **Nounish proliferation.** 

Over a 6 month period, our goal is to onboard and empower musicians, build upon the existing Noun Sounds platform, create a DAO structure and develop new systems for **musicians and music lovers to create, share and participate in Noun Sounds**- building a self-sustaining community around all things music.

## **Total: 245.5 ETH**

*(See bottom of proposal for funding breakdown)*

## Proposal Outline

From January-June 2023, Noun Sounds Pod will:

→  **Empower + Onboard Musicians** 

→  **Further Develop Nouns Sounds Platform** 

→  **Nounish Partnerships** 

→ **Create Noun Sounds DAO**

## Empowering + Onboarding Musicians

![](https://i.imgur.com/DvdegTr.jpg)

One of our top initiatives is to empower musicians through funding and community building.  Our initial conversations include: 

- **Large-scale Artist 61ETH**
    - **Ghostface Killah from Wu-Tang Clan:** *in discussions about making a CC0 song and sound pack for Noun Sounds + a photoshoot with the Noggles glasses.  Ghost has millions of fans and he digs the Noggles.*
    
        - *If the collaboration with Ghostface Killah does not happen, the full 61ETH will be sent back to NounsDAO*

- **Indie-artist 23ETH**
    - **Lisa Caruso:** *A talented indie artist from Australia, Lisa has had her music featured on major network TV shows and has released a slew of cool music and visuals.  Our plan is to create a Nounish E.P. and sound pack with her + a mini-doc following her creative process.*
- **Prop House x Noun Sounds 19.5ETH**
    
    We will be leveraging Prop House rounds for musicians to onboard new talent for songs, sounds, music videos and more.  One Prop House round every month for 6 months:
    
    - **2ETH x 5** - *Musicians will submit their music catalog and NS voters will choose (5) artists to make a new Nounish CC0 song/beat.*
    - **1ETH x 5** - *Musicians will submit their music catalog and be hired to create a CC0 sample pack containing loops and samples.*
    - **.5ETH x 4** - *Creators can make a video for Save The Music with the purpose of amassing educational content for students (i.e. “How To Play The Guitar 101”).*
    - **.25ETH x 10** - *Anyone can submit their audio catalog and NS holders will vote for artists to create new CC0 sound effects and real-world sounds (i.e. recording the ocean or other foley sounds)*

## Further Develop Nouns Sounds Platform

![](https://i.imgur.com/VmKPbpi.png)

Part of our MVP was building out the PLAYground section of the Noun Sounds website.  Building upon this, we will be creating new tools and features within the NS platform as we grow our pod:

- **Mint Playlists: The Nouns Player**
    - Meet the **Nouns Player companion**: A free *“Winamp”-style audio player that will be able to pull music from Spotify, read from the playlists and allow you to enjoy each **curation**.*
    - Creators will be able to mint playlists of songs and podcasts from their catalogues. Taste-Makers and Curators will be able capture a moment in time and create communities around each of them.
    - This not only allows artists to create but also empowers one of the most important thing in music: **curation**.
    - *Each Nouns Player will have the option of creating custom skins for their companion.* Thus, the Playlist Creator will come along with an **Album Art and “Skins” creator tool** for the music player.
    - These playlists will allow creators and curators to offer token gated content (on their websites or through channels in their discords) based on each of their mintable playlists.
- **Artist Profiles**
    - *Artists and creators* will be able to setup their own custom page to showoff their catalogue and give updates. You’ll be able to read about their work, see what packs they’re just released, or check out what playlists are currently minting.
- **Profesional** **Music Creator Tools**
    - **VST Instruments:** *Offering tools to experienced musicians*, we will be creating professional instruments that can be used in music-making programs. From keyboards, vocals, synths, drums and more- music makers can download, install and get to making their own Noun Sounds within their existing audio workstation.
    - **Soundboard:** A fully functional CC0 soundboard on Noun Sounds for use across all Twitter Spaces and more. One of our most requested features.

![](https://i.imgur.com/2og8Ys1.png)



## Nounish Partnerships
![](https://i.imgur.com/PH0pU8p.png)

Partnering with **[Save The Music](https://www.savethemusic.org/)**, we will proliferate the good vibes via IRL impacts and educational experiences. Save The Music partners with school districts and local communities to build sustainable music programs. Noun Sounds will start by running a Prop House with STM and include the partnership in future DAO proposals, while assisting them in the web3 landscape. 


## Noun Sounds DAO
![](https://i.imgur.com/lyE5x23.png)

Using the Nouns Builder, Noun Sounds will create a daily auction to onboard new users into the Noun Sounds ecosystem.  Holding a Noun Sounds NFT allows you to put proposals on chain, vote on proposals and have an overall voice in the direction of the Noun Sounds treasury and growth.

## Costs Breakdown

**103.5ETH -** Onboarding world-renowned and indie musicians via collaborations and Prop House rounds.

**67ETH -** SuperTightWoody- DAO partnerships, operations, music/content production, music communications and community management.

**67ETH -** Papaya - Platform upgrades, CC0 music onboarding flow, mintable “Winamp”-style Nouns Player tools: playlist maker via Spotify API and custom player “Skins” art tools, professional CC0 music tools: DAW/Kontakt VST and soundboard.

**8ETH** - Reserved for lawyer fees; we will need contracts and legal advice on releasing creators music as CC0.

# TL;DR:

***The Noun Square* was [funded for a 5 month term](https://nouns.wtf/vote/128) to continue doing Nounish Twitter Spaces every single day, plus to expand our reach into other mediums and socials, while acting as an onboarding and community hub for Nouns.** 
 
**We have *crushed* all of our metric goals, 4X-ing our Twitter impressions and daily listens, going viral on TikTok with 8MM+ views, and becoming one of the go-to Nouns DAO onboarding sources for artists, builders, and new Nouners alike. We even managed to squeeze an extra month of operations out of our budget by creating a game ([NOMO Nouns](https://nomo.wtf)) that has generated 7 ETH for the show during its beta release alone.** 

**Our proposed budget for the next 6 months of continued media growth and Community-As-A-Service to the DAO is 319 ETH (53 per month, including funds ear-marked for art contests and community project grants.) However, we are committing to self-raising 50 ETH of revenue through several crypto-native and media-native strategies.** 
 
**Therefore, our ask of the DAO today is *269 ETH.*  Please read on to better understand the work we have been doing, the impact we have been having, and our goals for the next 6 months. 👇**

**During that time, our team has met and surpassed ALL of the broad goals and specific metrics that we set out for ourselves in that proposal, and we've even stretched our operations an additional bonus month with careful budgeting and some supplemental internal revenue generation.**

## **In the past 6 months we have:**

✅  **accumulated over 36K followers across TNS socials**
✅  **went viral on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquare?_t=8ZObTMqcUti&_r=1) and received over 8.6MM video views across socials**
✅  **received over 5MM unique [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) impressions**
✅  **garnered nearly 57,000 Spaces Listens on Twitter**
✅  **hosted our flagship Noun O’ Clock [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1555308360051748864?s=20&t=DPT_X9reKFlKo_zYcjZoTw) show 230+ days in a row**
✅  **empowered and supported many Nounish communities and projects with communications and distribution**
✅  **onboarded countless talented artists, builders and creatives to the DAO, as well as welcoming many new Nouners as well**
✅  **developed a game + daily edition collection that has raised 7 ETH of revenue in 6 weeks.** 
✅ **built a CC0 nounish media company from the ground up**

Over the past 6 months, we have accumulated nearly **57K total [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) listens to our spaces,** hosting a total of **580 unique spaces**, including our flagship daily NOC LIVE and a slate of weekly community spaces through a new program called **The SoapBox.**

*Twitter Spaces Metrics: Up and to the Right*

## What is The Noun Square SoapBox?

The SoapBox Network was developed by TNS as a way to leverage our platform to provide Nounish communities with a voice, as well as opportunities to cross-pollinate and collaborate with other groups in the ecosystem.

*If The Noun Square is meant to depict an old town plaza with a clocktower in the centre, **The SoapBox** imagery might evoke passionate nounish subcommunities such as [Lil Nouns](https://lilnouns.wtf), [Food Nouns](https://foodnouns.wtf) and [Gnars](https://gnars.wtf) dragging a soapbox into the Square to stand atop and give a rousing speech to their own community of nounsfolk.*

Stepping back out of the realm of metaphor, SoapBox is, simply put, a Network that allows any community in the orbit of Nouns to host weekly Twitter Spaces on [The Noun Square Twitter account](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) (usually co-hosted from their own account), allowing them to bootstrap an audience that is comprised of a mix of their own fans, TNS's unique community, and spillover audiences from other SoapBoxes as well.

*Nouners Gami and Brennen (of Gnars and Nouns Esports respectively) on their experience with SoapBox*


At present, we are hosting approximately **38 Twitter interesting and well-attended spaces per week**, including our daily  Noun O' Clock spaces and the various TNS Soapboxes. 

# Twitter Engagement 

In addition to our healthy Twitter Spaces metrics, TNS also has a robust track record of increasing both unique impressions and 100% organic engagement on Twitter, from a combination of art contests and games, as well as cross-posting quality nounish content from other accounts and communities too. 

[![twitter-engagement-chart.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/2SWdK01J/twitter-engagement-chart.gif)](https://postimg.cc/Yvpm4fff)
*Impress-ive Numbers*

At the time of our previous Proposal, we had achieved 1.2MM impressions across all our posts, and the baseline trend through to present would have carried us to about 3MM impressions. 

**In reality, our impression growth has been exponential, with a 5X increase to over 5.4MM in a 5 month period.** (See chart above.) 

Similarly, our Profile Visits were up **4.6X to 446K**, and we completely blew through our previous Proposal goal of 5000 followers, as we are trending towards **close to 6000 Twitter followers as of this proposal.** 

Here is a screenshot from Prop 128 showing our year-end goals for Twitter followers and daily Spaces Listens, both of which we have exceeded (6000 vs. 5000 and 380+ vs. 200 respectively):

[![follower-goal.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XvGwCQbx/follower-goal.png)](https://postimg.cc/1gSnx04N)

# Other Media Channels

Although the focus of Prop 128 was growing our Twitter Spaces reach and onboarding artists and creators to Nouns, part of our vision for this time was also to begin experimenting with content for other platforms such as YouTube and TikTok, to complement our Twitter content strategy. We have had some success with both of these platforms during this trial, especially on TikTok (where we went viral in December and continue to get great numbers.)

## TikTok

[NounFungibleNikki](https://twitter.com/web3nikki) and [Hypnos](https://twitter.com/hypnoseffect) had been working as a team on a Nounish [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquare) presence for the NounsNews Project, before that project was discontinued in the fall.

Seeing their impressive efforts and consistency, TNS approached and asked them to join forces and **merge our TikTok accounts together under the TNS banner.** *(Was this the first Nounish Acquisition in history? Maybe not explicitly, but it was nonetheless the beginning of an amazing collaborative relationship that has produced some of our most popular and viral nounish content over the past months.)*

Shortly after bringing Nikki and Hypnos into the TNS team, we also saw that [JP](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp) had been getting some really impressive attention on TikToks he had created for a Brazilian Noggle sticker campaign [""Encontre o adesivo.""](https://www.tiktok.com/@encontreoadesivo?_t=8ZOeB0NEt9x&_r=1) We invited him to join the team, both to run a Portuguese Language TNS TikTok Account, and to advise Nikki and Hypnos on English language TT content strategy as well.

**Under the guidance of this new team, the growth of our TikTok presence has been nothing short of incredible; from a baseline of 37,000 views in September, to a steady ~100K in October and November, and then spiking dramatically to over 8 million views in the month of December:**

[![tiktok-metrics-prop.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/RVh8YxQ0/tiktok-metrics-prop.gif)](https://postimg.cc/xcrtk7Zr)
*Exponential TikTok Audience growth.*

A clever video collaboration between JP on the [TNS Brazil account](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkge7F/) and N/H on the [main TNS account](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLk4k7G/) managed to go viral twice, one version on each account. After this video (a lighthearted curiosity-hook about nounish tattoos), many of our other videos, including trend videos, interviews and educational shorts, began to accumulate views and organic engagement as well. 

For example, check out this TikTok re-packaging of an [@Nounish video](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkvGGQ/) (with their permission) with **nearly 30K views.** Or this video of Nikki interviewing a [Nouns Vision-wearing Farokh at Art Basel](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkvGGQ/), with **almost 80K views.** Or this [followup to the tattoo video](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkgxjT/) where Nikki explains what Noggles and Nouns are, which has just under **70 thousand views** so far as well. 

[![tiktok-thumbnails.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/rFKPygFN/tiktok-thumbnails.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/qzHLjsKN)

We also ran a very successful Public Good contest on TikTok called **#NounsGiveBack**, calling on our viewers and community to **do something good** in their local community and submit a video showing what they'd done. We had participants from all over the world who submitted some really inspiring entries. 

The hashtag #NounsGiveBack on TT has received **over 300K views** across our own posts and all of the entries to date. A 2-minute recap video summarizing many of the amazing submissions has received **over 32.5K views** as well, [you can watch it here.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkb4JM/) We are planning to launch a second Public Good contest as well in the coming weeks using the same hashtag. 

At present, both TNS TikTok accounts have amassed over 30,000 combined unique followers, over 850K ""Likes"" across our videos, and nearly 8.5MM total views on all videos. For more metrics, our TikTok team has prepared a short deck that provides some additional details and insights [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d_ezmaSVbTC345t0W33Py_PmIXrVdXrTO9xnxPYalIY/edit?usp=sharing)

**This is a huge opportunity to proliferate Nouns, especially to a younger generation of artists and builders, and we are excited to see what the TNS TikTok Dream Team can achieve over the next 6 months with a renewed mandate and continued enthusiasm.**

## YouTube

We have also begun some experimentation on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@thenounsquare) in 3 main ways during this proposal period: 
1) Streaming all notable Twitter Spaces to YT Live for alternate tune-in and listen-back options; 
2) Creating and hosting evergreen/educational nounish video content; and 
3) Hosting/re-hosting of co-branded video content from other nounish projects such as House of Nouns and Nouns AI. 

[![youtube-examples.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/xCt8cB1X/youtube-examples.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/TL5fs7mx)

Our [YT Live streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSleWkgQ8_s) of daily Twitter Spaces have picked up an extra 20-30 daily listens on average, while also serving as a more permanent living archive of our Twitter content (helpful since Twitter deletes Spaces Recordings after 90 days.)

Some examples of our evergreen content would be the [""Nounsplaining Web3 Terms""](https://youtu.be/6Tu56yn6MoA) series with Aubtoshi and SuperTightWoody, and the [""Prop House Profiles""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY6_cpQZBpc) interview series with Toady Hawk. In both cases, these series have been produced in a way that they can be viewed either today or in 5 years and still be relevant. As we grow, especially in new mediums like video, having a healthy repertoire of interesting educational content is valuable, as new eyeballs arrive on our accounts and will be immediately greeted by helpful onboarding content.

Finally, our co-branded content strategy: For example, [House of Nouns' thoughtful weekly Voter Companion show ""Prop Talk""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJe17dn9TIk&t=5s) was premiered on our YT channel in addition to their other podcast services, resulting in more views for their content and more useful content for our audience. The same can be said for Recordings of the [AI Pod weekly Discord calls.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJe17dn9TIk&t=5s) 

We know that YouTube continues to be a great opportunity for future growth, and we plan to devote more resources to building out our presence and content on this platform over the coming months. 


# 2) The Noun Square as an Onboarding and Community Hub

Over the past 6 months, TNS has cemented itself as a pillar of the Nouns DAO community, supporting funded projects and sub-DAOs alike, while also welcoming builders, artists and new Nouners to the DAO with open arms.      

**In our estimation, this role of providing Community-As-A-Service to the DAO is every bit as important as the proliferation and distribution role outlined in the previous section.**

[![tns-discord-members.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/43Qgvwch/tns-discord-members.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/940KCdJW)

After the original Nouns discord was switched to read-only, we worked to embrace the diaspora and create a guidepost to the Nouniverse. We thoughtfully did this in our Discord server and on TNS shows, so as not to simply try and replicate what was just disbanded, but rather create a neutral space where people can learn more at their own pace and find their own way to get more involved in the Nouns ecosystem. As a result, with **966 members**, our TNS Discord is now one of the largest (if not *the* largest) active nounish servers by membership. 



## More Info About The SoapBox Network 

[![the-soapbox-network-graphic-copy.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/QdTsWCbL/the-soapbox-network-graphic-copy.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/75wjFxdX)

Over the course of this past funding period, our **SoapBox Network** has grown from nothing into a weekly itinerary of 38+ spaces that have provided a turn-key platform to 15+ nounish projects and communities including *Shark DAO, Lil Nouns DAO, Lil Sisters Fund, Nouns esports, Food Nouns, Nouns Builder, UMA DAO, Gnars DAO, Nouns Africa, Nouns DAO Amigos, Nouns Brasil, InternatioNouns, Nouns Agora, House of Nouns, NounBA, Lil Toadz DAO / Cryptoadz and more.* 

This initiative has empowered these nounish communities to consistently engage their membership on a weekly basis, cross-pollinate and collaborate with each other. It has also helped TNS greatly in our role of onboarding new people to Nouns, allowing our team to often say to newcomers: *""Just spend a week listening to TNS Spaces and you will find your nounish people.""*


## **SoapBox is a true symbiotic ""Win-Win-Win-Win"" arrangement:** 

* Nouns DAO benefits from a passionate and interconnected web of communities, all employing different strategies to proliferate the ⌐◨-◨ meme to different demographics. 
* The Noun Square benefits from additional engaging content for our various distribution streams and from having multiple active funnels from which to grow our own community. 
* SoapBox partners benefit from a turn-key solution to host spaces with minimal planning or coordination required on their part, and the opportunity to reach new eyeballs from different corners of the ecosystem. 
* And finally, the Nouns community at large benefits from a full daily slate of Nounish content and a one-stop-shop to catch up on everything happening in the Nouniverse.  

[![nounsamigos-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/VNZ2K6bg/nounsamigos-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/VSM76zg0) *A bilingual testimonial from Nouns DAO Amigos about their experience as a SoapBox partner.*

In addition to empowering nounish sub-DAOs, subcultures and communities, the SoapBox Network has also been a powerful tool for TNS to help other funded nounish projects with their DAO communications and user growth. Some examples:

* We have partnered with **[Nouns Agora](https://nounsagora.com/)** to co-host **[weekly public DAO discussions and townhalls](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1604658668007718912?s=20&t=XqFEz89ZZsqi1CbnriseCA)** about Nouns DAO Proposals that have produced very interesting dialog and have been very well attended and received. [Yitong](https://twitter.com/zhayitong) from Agora had this to say about TNS's efforts: 

[![agora-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/qBLSFNrr/agora-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/YjvdGqjD)
* We hosted a **[Technical Townhall about Rage Quit](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1604965283478884382?s=20&t=XqFEz89ZZsqi1CbnriseCA)** with The Verbs team of Elad and David, which also was very well attended and was the venue for some very important conversations between 4156, VapeApe, 0xHindsight, DigitalOIl and others. 
* We have partnered with **[House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.xyz/)** on two fronts: 1) Hosting co-branded video versions of their weekly voter companion podcast ""Prop Talk"" on The Noun Square YouTube (amplified on our Twitter), and 2) Hosting a live discussion SoapBox by the same name on Twitter Spaces weekly. [Christian](https://twitter.com/ByHardy) from HoN shares his experience here: 

[![house-of-nouns-quote.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FspsFFQg/house-of-nouns-quote.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/w7td0pM7)

* We have hosted on many occasions ""PopUp Soapboxes"" by request for several Nounish projects, such as:
    1) [A Bud Light NEXT Happy Hour](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1612847677330554880?s=20&t=XqFEz89ZZsqi1CbnriseCA) (which was very well attended - we are in the process of potentially turning into a regular event.) 
    2) A [Basketball X Nouns event](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1615211446454943745?s=20&t=XqFEz89ZZsqi1CbnriseCA) in collaboration with [NounBA](https://twitter.com/nounba_wtf) and [Vesselverse](https://twitter.com/VesselVerse). 
    3) A [Bilingual Chinese-English space](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1601052527029817345?s=20&t=XqFEz89ZZsqi1CbnriseCA) featuring Noun 74 and the Chinese Cryptopunks community, which was also simulcast on Binance Live. 
    
[![nounba-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FzbQ1pdn/nounba-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/zHfQcnkn)

**We believe that, again, in the absence of a centralized Nouns Discord, providing a public and neutral space for discussion of Nouns Proposals and DAO governance is an important and powerful part of our mandate that we hope to nurture and grow in the coming months.**


## On-Boarding New Nouners to the DAO

Another aspect of our daily community-building efforts is our consistent commitment to reaching out and engaging with folks on Twitter, Twitter Spaces, TikTok, etc. to answer their questions about Nouns and explain how they can get involved.  

**We have also reached out to new Nouners on a weekly basis to invite them on the daily Noun O' Clock show as guests and help them introduce themselves to the community.** We have had many new Nouners on the show including *Taco Noun, Digital Oil, shan96, darlington, 0xpiney, susuc, pNouns, NickyG, Nounvestment Fund, Variant Fund, Valko*, and more. Invariably they have all had positive feedback about their experience! 

A couple recent examples: 

[![monstercat-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/BQ2Nj6Sy/monstercat-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/mt27qTFN)

[![digital-oil-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/DZMSB2xK/digital-oil-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/vg58mdRP)
 

## The FOMO Factor

TNS has also had a tangible effect on Nouner onboarding with our efforts to coordinate FOMO every night on our Noun O' Clock LIVE Twitter Spaces. In several instances, we have been asked by people to try to FOMO mint a specific Noun head, which we have done successfully and then this has often directly resulted in said Noun being purchased. *Nouns 404, 433, 453, 472, 487, 506, 532, 542, 552, 562, 569, 577 & 578 (to name a few) are all examples of Nouns we FOMO'd by request and were purchased as a result.* 

[![modrovsky-quote-prop.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/MpmXg095/modrovsky-quote-prop.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/LJhH1PKg)*Modrovsky, on his experience asking TNS to FOMO him an Index Card head.*

We believe playing FOMO every day has led to minting more aesthetic nouns on average also, and as part of the fun, we aim to mint nouns for cultural events and occasions too. For example, we minted a rabbit for Chinese New Year (while hosting Nouns DAO China), 2 Rose Buds for the Rose Parade, a snowman head on Christmas day, and a basketball, knowing that the nouns acquisition committee were likely to want one for [Victor](https://twitter.com/victorsolomon)'s basketball court restoration proposal.

## On-Boarding Artists and Contributors to Nouns

By encouraging artistic expression and rewarding creation through our weekly community art contests, The Noun Square has prompted the creation of 1000's of Nounish illustrations, sculptures, food items, videos, costumes and more.

Using TNS as a launch-pad, artists from around the world have entered into the Nouniverse and have found great success. Artists that started with TNS contests have been commissioned by Nouns communities, minted their own collections, been featured in IRL exhibitions and other collections, and have begun collaborating with each other as well:

![](https://i.imgur.com/VZKy0me.jpg)
*Special Holiday Edition mint by @0xaprilia, @ilustradoraeth, @DesenhistaRedn, @amiyoko_eth, @facuserif, @Greta_gremplin, @Messhup, many of whom were exposed to Nouns via TNS*

After winning our contests, many artists have had the opportunity to work with us on art inspired by the daily Noun that we give away as POAPs on our Twitter Spaces. Each commissioned artist does 7 or 8 pieces of art for that week. Some examples of the 230+ POAPs we have given out since inception:

[![poap-compilation-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/LX6zHr5v/poap-compilation-gif.gif)](https://postimg.cc/Ff8fpCjJ)

And here's a brief reel showing many of the beautiful Nounish art pieces created by our community members over the past months:

[![contest-supercut.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/3NdxD2cG/contest-supercut.gif)](https://postimg.cc/D43T94Ff) 

## A Few TNS Artist Success Stories:
After being introduced to Nouns via one of our earliest art contests, talented South Korean artist [Jhee](https://twitter.com/jheeart_nft) has gone on to mint collections including her popular watercolor-styled ""With Noun"" collection. Her art is really beautiful:


![](https://i.imgur.com/MtqCAsM.jpg)


She has also been featured in IRL galleries, created merchandise and hosted her own exhibitions! 


[Arash](https://twitter.com/ArashSlacker), an Iranian animator living in Turkey, was on-boarded by several members of the TNS team. He premiered his [Shrimpy Burger Nouns](https://youtu.be/nQIsqHWERoE) music video on TNS YouTube, collaborated with Nouns Sounds on [""The Bomb""](https://youtu.be/cQjWXc2EHQk) music video, is creating a pretty cool [Nouns Video Game](https://youtu.be/Xz-ouU8xErE), and more.

[![arash-gif.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/HnLFfjVm/arash-gif.gif)](https://postimg.cc/WFQ9ZNGY)


[0xAprilia](https://twitter.com/0xaprilia) came to Nouns via TNS art contests and has launched their own collections, created artwork for Nouncil, helped with multiple Nouns Proposals' art, and will be a resident artist at boards.wtf as well. Some of her art:

![](https://i.imgur.com/BJthO5e.jpg)

[Duckhead](https://twitter.com/_duckhead) entered into an [Unminted Noun Heads](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1565289442302099456?s=20&t=8XVpnHHkMX1IvWAgeqFRsg) contest and created a beautiful Box Noun Resin Figurine, which later was produced and sold out its initial order. They've continued to create more Nouns as figures and create one of a kind Nouns resin art!

![](https://i.imgur.com/nF7SFbT.jpg)


In addition to empowering hundreds of artists, TNS has also funded social goods efforts around the world with challenges like our [Cleanup Contest](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1567969949829693440), which inspired community cleanup efforts the world over. One of the winners of this competition, [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye), **went on to be funded by Nouns Prop House to do a larger cleanup effort, and then eventually founded Nouns DAO Africa as a result of these initiatives!**

## Two Successful Trial Prop House Rounds:

To complement our efforts to fund Nounish artists through our consistent Twitter art contests, we wanted to allocate a portion of our Prize budget to pilot [two Prop House Rounds](https://prop.house/the-noun-square) to extend the same kind of support to other creators and builders in our community. 

We coordinated two rounds, one with 5 prizes of 2 ETH each, and one with 10 prizes of 1 ETH. In both cases, we were very impressed with the quantity and quality of submissions. In fact, there were so many quality submissions, we ended up awarding a total of 3 extra Bonus Prizes as well. We received 63 proposals over both rounds, and here are just a few of the projects that were funded and have executed:

* A team that created a [substack newsletter](https://prop.house/the-noun-square/round-1/1727) to post summaries of every Noun O' Clock LIVE Twitter Spaces for those who missed. 
* A Portuguese language Twitter Spaces called *Bora Buildar Brasil*  that is airing [weekly on TNS SoapBox](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1613830382323105793?s=20&t=8XVpnHHkMX1IvWAgeqFRsg).
* A collection of [custom made resin trophies](https://prop.house/the-noun-square/round-1/1714) made by [Duckhead](https://twitter.com/_duckhead) in the image of the TNS mascot ""Nouny Clock."" 
* A [series of animated shorts](https://twitter.com/MALCOM_ERANDA/status/1586408060171747330?s=20&t=8XVpnHHkMX1IvWAgeqFRsg) based on memorable clips from our Twitter Spaces shows. 
* A [tree planting operation](https://twitter.com/NounsCare) in the Philippines. 
* & many more!




# 3) Project Goals For The Next 6 Months

These are the goals and target metrics we will strive to achieve over the next 6 months:

**Broad Strategic Goals:**
* Continue our unbroken consistent streak of Noun O' Clock Twitter Spaces as an important daily touchpoint for the community, and effective onboarding funnel for people new to Nouns. We will continue to keep our Spaces content engaging and interesting, and pursue bigger guests even more regularly to draw in larger crowds and continue/accelerate our current trend of growth.
* Increase production of educational/evergreen video content for YouTube, and concentrate on continued growth of YouTube following and engagement.
* Continue to build and grow the TNS TikTok accounts followers and engagement in both English and Portuguese.  
* Continue to offer distribution and DAO communications support to Nounish projects such as Agora, House of Nouns and Nouns AI + providing support and additional distribution for Aubtoshi's Nouns On The Air Podcast Series.  
* Maintain and grow the SoapBox network, including expanding it to some communities on the periphery of Nouns and possibly suitable communities outside the ecosystem. 
* Continue to make a concerted effort to reach out to all new Nouners and invite them on NOC LIVE + help them orient themselves in the DAO as best we can. 
* Host and moderate thoughtful DAO discourse on Proposals on a weekly basis.
* Continue to ideate and administer creative art contests that produce positive social media engagement and amazing User Generated Content, plus attracts and onboards talented artists from around the world into the ecosystem.  
* Continue to experiment with and document decentralized project management and team compensation (all team comp disbursed by recurring retro rounds according to contribution and/or grants for specific projects completed.) 
* Experiment with alternate language versions of TNS Twitter, as we have been trialing with a TNS Spanish and TNS Portuguese Account. 
* Be a leader in the Nouns space on the front of finding paths toward sustainability (more on this in the ""Sustainability Strategy"" section below.)

**Specific Metric Goals:**

* Grow Twitter following to minimum 11K over the next 6 months (which would make our account the largest nounish project account by followers after @nounsdao)
* Grow total Twitter impressions to 20MM+
* Grow total Listens metric to 120K+
* Organically grow YouTube subscribership to 690+ with consistent and quality content (minimum 2 pieces of video content per week.)
* Build TNS TikTok accounts to 50K+ combined followers and 12MM+ combined views. (Target of 200 videos posted with consistent cadence over the next 6 months.)  
* Allocate 70+ ETH to builders and artists through art contests/commissions and community project funding. 
* Challenge ourselves to raise 50ETH in revenue over the next 6 months to defray our operations budget with a combination of crypto-native and media-native experiments (more on this in the ""Sustainability Strategy"" section below.)
* Onboard at least one new artist to Nouns per month through contests, POAP commissions or other community initiatives. 
* Land strategic partnerships with at least two brands/communities outside the Nouns ecosystem. 


# 4) The Team

**The Noun Square continues to operate with a novel decentralized project management system loosely based on the original Nouncil governance documents.** Members of both the Core and Support teams can rotate in and out as needed, depending on schedule and commitments, allowing others to step in and step up as needed. All compensation is calculated by periodic retro round allocations, or by specific project-based grants. 

This format has allowed interested community members to land in TNS from a contest or a Twitter space, start contributing, and then become part of the Support Team or even the Core Team based on nothing but merit, effort and output. 

Running the daily operations of TNS is no small task and encompasses myriad responsibilities, including but not limited to: 

*Production and planning for daily NOC show, Administration of SoapBox Spaces, schedule and coordination of Hosting and co-hosting of daily show, creation, editing and publication of YouTube and TikTok content, general content ideation and strategy, POAP artist coordination and administration, POAP creation and delivery, contest ideation, administration and execution, tracking and administration of contest prizes and payments, retro round administration and payroll, administration of Prop House rounds, booking guests for all shows, Twitter and other social engagement, maintaining Show schedule and Tweeting Spaces daily, onboarding conversations, business and partnership development, Discord management and moderation etc.*

**Core Team (And most Common Responsibilities):**
* [Toady Hawk](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk) (Founder, project management & Strategy, Twitter management, Space hosting, Coordination/Administration, Business development) 
* [Aubtoshi](https://twitter.com/aubtoshi_nft) (Space hosting, video content, coordination/administration)
* [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi) (High Level Strategy, POAP coordination, Contest Payments, Co-hosting, Discord/YouTube admin)
* [Joshua Fisher](https://twitter.com/JoshuaFisher) (Contest ideation and coordination, Hosting, High Level Strategy)

We have also kept public records of every single retro round we have completed for team compensation to date (to our knowledge we are the only Nouns-funded project to have provided this level of operational transparency). Nouners are welcome to review the document [here](
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zmEFFLxUszyKZzo8CJP6KlXC581NkPLtek4GN6h7T8/edit#gid=977336365).

# 5) Proposed Budget:

**Monthly expenditures August-Present:**
*Team Comp and misc operations: 38 ETH
Contest Prizes, art commissions, community project grants: 12 ETH
(We continued operations through January as a bonus)*

**New Budget:**
Monthly Team Compensation Budget: 42 ETH 
Monthly contest Prizes, community art commissions, community project grants: 11.17 ETH

*Total Ask Per Month = 53.17 X 6 Month term = 319 ETH (Before Sustainability Efforts, See Below.)*

# 6) Sustainability Strategy 

There has been some discussion in the DAO recently about the self-sustainablity of Nouns-funded projects. Notably, Nounder 4156 mentions here on Twitter that many beloved Nounish projects could be endangered in the medium-to-long term if they don't think seriously about a path to sustainability.  

[![4156-sustainability.png](https://i.postimg.cc/CLbF2Yxg/4156-sustainability.png)](https://postimg.cc/KRvSK6Tq)

That is why at TNS, we are implementing a 2-pronged strategy to gradually reduce our dependence on DAO funding, while continuing to bring value to the DAO and the community at large. In addition to reasonable DAO funding for provision of Community-As-A-Service and growing media distribution, we will also try:

1) Crypto-Native experiments in self-funding; and
2) Traditional Media experiments in self-funding.

**To reduce our total ask of the DAO, we are challenging ourselves to produce 50 ETH of revenue through a combination of a) NOMO Nouns daily edition mints, b) a TNS Nouns Fork using Builder DAO that celebrates talented artists in our community, and c) tiered sponsorship opportunities of our media channels.**


## A) NOMO NOUNS: A TNS-Developed Addition to the FOMO Experience 


NOMO NOUNS is a gamified daily edition mint, bootstrapped and developed in-house by TNS (shout out [Volky.eth](https://twitter.com/volkyeth).) It kicks off directly after FOMO Nouns and allows our audience on Noun O' Clock LIVE to pick one Noun that got passed over during FOMO (and is soon to be NO MO'), and save it from eternal blockchain purgatory by clicking like mad.  

[![nomo.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/sDwMSTgB/nomo.gif)](https://postimg.cc/KRvSK6Tq)

[![9999-nomo-testimonial.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/jSsDP21Z/9999-nomo-testimonial.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/mt5ZGLBH)

Once the game is over (about 60 seconds), the winning NOMO Noun is minted as a 24H open edition that is very affordable, but goes up in price every 15 minutes thereafter. So far in the first 6 weeks of beta, the feedback from our community has been overwhelmingly positive. People love the game, and have been minting the NOMOs even though we haven't fully developed either the game or the usefulness of the NFTs yet (it's currently mostly just for fun and *provenance.*) 



**We have raised over 7 ETH from NOMO so far, and all proceeds have gone directly to the TNS treasury (which allowed us to operate for a bonus month in January.)**

[![41-nomo-comment.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/HL1HFz7B/41-nomo-comment.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/YvRJW1RW)

Additionally, our TNS partner dev **Volky** is currently working on several improvements to the game and interface, and NOMO V2 will be released very soon. **Our vision is for NOMO to become an efficient single landing page for listeners of Noun O' Clock LIVE and beyond, and we're excited to roll out new features soon to that end.** In the meantime, just keep on clickin'!

## B) TNS DAO

In the next 30-45 days, we plan to launch a TNS DAO by forking Nouns using Nouns Builder. We have some exciting plans in motion to partner with and empower some of the incredible artists in our TNS community. We also have novel plans to integrate NOMO Nouns owners into the structure of the DAO, and ultimately envision a future in the medium-term where auction proceeds can net out the cost of much of our contest prizes and community project grants, in a true virtuous cycle of art and proliferation.   

## C) Sponsorships 

We are currently in discussions with several crypto-native organizations about potential secondary sponsorships (after Nouns DAO) of our Twitter Spaces, as well as video content on our YT and TikTok. We are working to balance the traditional media model with a more crypto-native approach to sponsorship, and with any confirmed partner collaborations, we will ensure that both the partner and our audience benefit mutually and safely. 

**With the three initiatives above, we believe we can meet our goal of raising 50 ETH in revenue over a 6 month period, and we are excited both for the challenge, and to set an example in the DAO as a project seeking paths to semi-self-reliance.**

# 7) The Revised Ask

## Projected 6 Month Operations Budget of 319 ETH, minus 50 ETH of targeted TNS revenue = **269 ETH Total Ask**



# 8) Conclusion 
To sum it all up, The Noun Square is a growing media hub and onboarding/educational platform for Nouns DAO and the Nouniverse. We aim to bring value to existing and new people through many impactful initiatives, as outlined in this proposal, and we will continue to iterate and improve daily (the beauty of creating nounish media every single day.)

**The detailed metrics and information in this prop are important and demonstrate the tangible value that TNS brings to the broader Nouns community. But numbers and details can also be overwhelming in a world of information overload.** Numbers and details don’t tell the whole story. We hope that this prop and the discussion around the funding and sustainability of TNS will allow you to see and hear the story of what we’ve been able to build alongside our audience: **an onboarding hub for the Nouniverse, and a cc0 media company, kickstarted by Nouns.**

What ESPN’s Sportscenter is to most sports fans, that’s the role TNS is playing for many currently in their Nounish journey. And it will continue to hold that place as the next 1000 come into the Nouniverse, and the 1000 after that. This prop can’t properly tell the stories of many artists who went from relative obscurity to sustainable work thanks to their onboarding to Nouns. The prop can’t tell of the 50 builders who were either ushered into Prop House victories for the first time, or brought onto the TNS team as their first chance to work in web 3, or who found people to create and build alongside in a nounish subdao, thanks to TNS. 

It can't tell how TNS was a springboard to new ventures in the Nouniverse. How we were a shot of energy into the proliferation stars of NounsDAO Brazil, or Africa. **And the prop can’t tell the story of 100+ who have found their footing in web3, found their tribe in the Nouniverse, and will find themselves on a Nounish web3 journey for years to come.** 

These people are the next stars of the Nouniverse. They are future Nouners, too. And to be honest, they are the real stars of TNS. This prop can’t tell all those stories. For those who are not a part of the TNS orbit, we hope the discussion of this prop during the on-chain period allows you to hear that human story alongside the numbers and the metrics, so that you get a feel for the full picture of the value of TNS to the Nouniverse.

## Thank you for your time!


# 9) A Special Edition TNS X Messhup Mint
Upon successful execution of this proposal, ""The Meta-Square,"" a special TNS-inspired edition by Messhup, will be minted by the TNS Deployer to mark the occasion and at the same time offer a beautiful collectible piece to all our supporters (and detractors?) 

This mint will be open for 5 days after execution of the Prop (if passed) at a cost of 0.0420 ETH each (for the culture.) Half the proceeds will go to TNS, half will be returned to the DAO.  

# 10) The Transactions & Multisig

* One transaction of 269 ETH to the TNS Multisig (3/5), consisting of trusted community members who have been serving on said MS since August/2022: Toady Hawk, Noun 142, Benbodhi, SuperTightWoody & Maty.eth. 
* One transaction which will mint Messhup's ""The Meta-Square"" as a Timed Open Edition on Zora upon execution of the Prop.

## TL;DR
Through the dissemination of NounsDAO's symbolic motif ""Noggle"", we aim to promote grassroots awareness of NounsDAO's activities in the untapped big market of Japan, as well as to promote social networking by festival participants.


It is estimated that there are only about 15,000 NFT holders for Japan's population of 120 million. On the other hand, Twitter has 45 million users, Instagram 33 million, and TikTok 9.5 million, making it one of the most popular social networking sites in the world.

Participation in Design Festa (held twice a year in May and November), a festival of professional and amateur art, is also an opportunity to impress the Nouns community (Nouns DAO activities such as NounsDAO, pNounsDAO, and NounsDAOJapan).



### Date:　May 20 (Sat.) & 21 (Sun.), 2023 (phase1)
### Place: Tokyo Big Sight
### Event name: Booth ""Noggles Jack ⚡️ Tokyo "" in Design Festa VOL.57
### Planning： pNouns⚡️DAO Design Festa  Team

![pNouns](https://pnouns.wtf/assets/images/noggles/image14.png)


![pNouns](https://pnouns.wtf/assets/images/noggles/image1.png)

### What is pNouns⚡️DAO?　
Sympathizing with the idea of NounsDAO and the smart contract mechanism, we started our activities in October 2022, won the bid for Nouns553,556 with the proceeds from the full on-chain generalized NFT issuance in December 2022, and started full-scale activities as Nouns subDAO."" Under the slogan ""Bringing the activities of NounsDAO to Japan, from Japan to the world, and energizing society through Japanese manufacturing,"" NounsDAO disseminates information about its realistic approach to manufacturing and the Nouns community both domestically and internationally.
We are aiming to automate voting and polling using smart contracts, the core of DAO, by the end of this year, and system development is proceeding simultaneously. In addition, we plan to sell the second NFT and purchase the third Noun after March of this year. Number of members Approximately 600 (number of NFT holders)

Lil Nouns, Gnars, Goop (and many others), are examples of projects that have acquired Nouns so that they can participate in governance.

Since there are no solutions for giving each member a voice in Nouns proposals, communities rely on delegates to cast votes on their behalf. Resulting in a community that feels less connected to Nouns, because they cannot participate directly in the governance process.

**Federation closes this gap by providing a way for communities to directly vote on Nouns proposals onchain. We call this crossDAO governance.**

[![goal](https://i.postimg.cc/DwhF0yv3/Untitled.png)](https://postimg.cc/VdK2Hw0K)

Moving forward we are extending Federation to support all forms of governance in the ecosystem such as integrating with Prop House and Nouns Builder, while also providing opportunities for owners of Nouns to generate value from them through new experiments like vote bidding.

To do this, we are seeking 225 ETH in funding to continue the development of Federation.

# Progress
As a winner of the [Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/nouns-governance-clients) mandated governance round (Aug ‘22), wiz took Federation from an idea to public infrastructure used by communities in the ecosystem. All code is open source and has been publicly available since the very first commit: [federation repository](https://github.com/nounish/federation/). 

Metrics:
- 40+ Nouns proposal votes cast through Federation contracts
- 5+ Nouns delegated to Federation contracts
- Proposal passed for Lil Nouns adoption (which holds 16 Nouns)

Communities currently on Federation:
- [Gnars](https://gnars.wtf/) 
- Goop Troop

Coming to Federation:
- [Lil Nouns](https://lilnouns.wtf/)
- [The Park](https://twitter.com/thepark)
- [Wizards DAO](https://wizardsdao.com)

Discussions are currently underway to onboard other communities in the ecosystem that have expressed interest in using Federation such as [SharkDAO](https://sharks.wtf/), [Purple](https://purple.construction/), and [PGodjira](https://twitter.com/pgodjira)

# Future roadmap and outcomes
[![crossdaomock](https://i.postimg.cc/tgfdbgPF/crossdaomock.png)](https://postimg.cc/v1rxLb0m)

We believe it’s time to take Federation from a POC to a scalable protocol designed for participating in crossDAO governance and generating value from Nouns ownership.

## Make crossDAO governance easy to understand, simple to do, and commonplace
- Design & build the new Federation v1 application and website
- Simplify the process of casting votes as a community
- Enable support for existing and future Nounish DAOs created via Nouns builder
- Continue onboarding Noun holding communities to Federation
- Community voting in Prop House rounds
- Optimize contracts to reduce storage costs, provide gas refunds, and execution incentives (MEV)
- Self directed contract deployment and management

## AutoBidder and Ongoing experimention
We plan to continuously release experiments that add value to the Nouns ecosystem. One area we are going to explore is an auto-bidder that enables a MEV driven approach to participating in Nouns auctions for communities and individuals.
- Allows bidding on Nouns auctions automatically
- Configurable max bid amounts
- Gas refunds and execution incentives

## Vote bidding
[![votebidding](https://i.postimg.cc/L85ZspmD/bidonvotes.png)](https://postimg.cc/cvqJDPgt)

Experimentation with crossDAO governance has led to the creation of a [novel vote bidding protocol](https://github.com/nounish/federation/commit/4ab02886abd26d405791fc399db57cc01034cd6b) aimed at giving Nouns holders the ability to monetize their governance rights. Turning the acquisition of a Noun into a revenue generating opportunity for individuals and communities alike.

In January, we ran an experiment auctioning off a **SINGLE** Noun vote. This led to the following metrics one week after launch:
- 2 unique bidders
- 3 votes cast
- 0.5 ETH value created

There is a lot more value that can be unlocked with vote bidding and we want to heavily invest in its future development. You can learn more and see it in action by visiting [bids.federation.wtf](http://bids.federation.wtf).

## Community outreach, supportive content and learning material
In addition to product development, we will focus on creating content that introduces people to the concepts and benefits of crossDAO governance and vote bidding, and tutorials that show interesting ways that these primitives can be used in the Nouns ecosystem. For example, teaching others how to use Federation with Nouns builder, PartyBid, or showing others how to stand up their own voting blocs (political parties).

# Ask
**225 ETH** to fund the continued development of [federation.wtf](http://federation.wtf) and its ecosystem for at least 6 months. (There are no plans to stop development after)
- Engineering and Design (175 ETH)
- OpEx including infrastructure costs, bounties, artwork, content, marketing (50 ETH)

If this proposal passes 1/2 of the funds will immediately be released to the team. The remainder will be held in a 3/5 multisig with the following signers:

- [wiz](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_)
- [ripe](https://twitter.com/ripe0x)
- [krel](https://twitter.com/krel404)
- [tmobil](https://twitter.com/TM0B1L)
- [al409](https://twitter.com/7x7x7eth)

# Previous Funding
20 ETH awarded for winning the Prop House mandated governance round (Aug ‘22). This was followed by a 12 ETH grant from Lil Nouns.

# Path to Sustainability
It is important for us to stay lean while developing Federation. To ensure this is the case, we believe pursuing funding from Nouns is the best option in the short term.

In the future, we see Federation becoming sustainable through the creation of its own Nouns Builder DAO.

Welcome to Nountown is an animated short film created via Prop 195 (in collaboration with 3dprintguy and Atrium) that will be released as a Timed Open Edition for a price of 0.0069 ETH. This means it will be available for anyone to mint for the specified minting period. The proceeds from sale will be split between Nouns (60%) and Atrium (40%).

We are excited to experiment with DAO NFT releases as an additional value capture mechanism, and potentially create a simple and repeatable model for any creator, community and brand in the ecosystem to put forward amazing artifacts to be minted via Nouns DAO.

This edition will be minted with Zora, and will be available to mint onchain and at [thisisnouns.wtf](https://thisisnouns.wtf)


### Release Details:
Title: 
Welcome to Nountown

Description: 
We now know the answer to WTF is a Noun, but the question of who the Nouns are still remains. 

""Welcome to Nountown"" serves as an introduction to the growing world of characters within the world of Nouns. 

Follow (Noun #1) through Nountown in a daring chase to ensure the Nounish glasses arrive at their destination, and build a foundation of future stories to come. Welcome to Nountown is the first in what we hope to be a series of Nounish adventures in created by Atrium and the community.

**TL;DR - Requesting 30 ETH** to fund the first Nounish curated arts exhibition on Nifty Gateway, aimed at showcasing and proliferating Nouns globally. ⌐◨-◨

![](https://i.imgur.com/kP9GJS9.png)

With the recent focus on bringing more attention to Nouns by collaborating with creators, as seen in Proposals [181](https://nouns.wtf/vote/181) and [180](https://nouns.wtf/vote/180), we want to showcase Nouns in partnership with [Nifty Gateway](https://www.niftygateway.com/). 

A curated nounish collection of high caliber art from OG contributing artists (presented below) who are ready to celebrate Nouns in all its glory. This will provide another entry point for individuals to the Nouns ecosystem through fine art collecting on the Nifty Gateway platform.

![](https://i.imgur.com/zuADEJp.png)

We want to create a recurring exhibition that features custom Nounish pieces created by two artists from each continent, participating in the web3 ecosystem. One established and the other emerging. This will create a unique and limited collection, aligned with the Nouns ethos, allowing a new collective of talent to spread the good of Nouns, globally, through doing what they love.

![](https://i.imgur.com/U9EK1gx.png)

[Proposal 190](https://nouns.wtf/vote/190) has shown there is high demand to collect Nounish art pieces that are custom and crafted. 3,526 NFTs were minted as an open edition of one historical piece, and now we believe we can create something special that [Nifty Gateway](https://www.niftygateway.com/) collectors will flock to. 

There is also clear evidence of fine-art generating profit and bringing awareness to Nouns in [Brandon Mighty's The Myth of Noun series on SuperRare.](https://superrare.com/series/0xca4607aad52f654cf6357895c397094c077a3236) Which has amassed 16.3 ETH in sales from a single artist's creations alone.

Rather than a one-off open edition mint of a historic piece or using one artist to tell the Nouns story, lets collaborate with many fine artists and give people beautiful Nounish art that they can collect and cherish.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Yd4uWoi.png)

All proceeds from the exhibition will be split 50/50 between the artists and the Nouns treasury. Not only does this provide fair compensation for the artists, but it also has the potential to generate returns for the DAO and further support its mission.

![](https://i.imgur.com/QOFD1dx.gif)

With Nifty Gateway's new exclusive publishers feature, it creates the perfect oppurtunity for Nouns to host a curated fine-art collection. Below are some stats on past Nifty drops, from the original Nifty Gateway Curated drops, to recent drops utilising the select publisher feature:

![](https://i.imgur.com/Xe8iFr2.png)

We already have the storefront set up at [⌐◨-◨.to/ng](https://xn----vpoz1kba.to/ng) and it's ready to fill with beautiful Nounish art. We'll commission two artists from each continent to create one Nounish piece of art each.

![](https://i.imgur.com/woQncKS.png)

 The curated selection ranges from emerging Nounish artists to already established Web3 OG artists, to give opportunity and add high value to the collection. Each drop will have a theme that fits the Nouns ethos. People from around the world, doing what they love, all in the name of Nouns.

Effective marketing of creative proposals is a common concern. We believe that through Nifty Gateway, the curated artists' networks and nouns related socials, we will generate the necessary hype and awareness for this proposal. [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/analytics/traffic/overview/?q=niftygateway.com&searchType=domain&compareWith=superrare.com:domain%7Cfoundation.app:domain%7Cnouns.wtf:domain) traffic estimates show ~ 668k unique visitors to niftygateway.com over the last 30 days.

As this Nouns fine art collection grows, along with a growing artist roster, the marketing efforts will snowball, thanks to the commitment of our collaborating artists and their collective audience across socials:

With a 50/50 split between the DAO and each artist, this prop has the potential to return the funds requested and then some. 

**Requesting 30 ETH funding:**

- Artwork creation 2 ETH per artist = 24 ETH
- Curation, promo and organisation = 6 ETH

**[Safe multisig](https://app.safe.global/eth:0xE1FAd61975f0D515C2695F654ca9c4031780Ea58/home) signers:**

We expect delivery of the first drop in May/June, allowing each of the artists ample time, while being respectful of the space required to create meaningful work that makes a lasting impression.

Thank you nouners, for your time and consideration.

**TLDR - Being the first feature film funded by Nouns, having the chance to take our Noggles to the main film festivals around the world and possibly being present in the main streaming catalogs.**

**""More Past than Future""** is the project of a documentary that will be shot in the heart of Casamance (southern region of Senegal), a small Muslim village, a kind of mystical island protected by religious guides called Marabus. A deep dive into a new world, full of rites, music, magic, secrets, fascinating images and testimonies of real characters who try to survive and maintain their traditions, in the midst of a civil war and the reality of goods smuggling.

# **The project**

![TOC](https://i.imgur.com/KuxOIe6.jpg)


Engaged in Brazil national black cinema and after visiting the African continent many times, it was in 2006 that Daniel Leite started recording the feature film ""Kabadio, where time goes slowly, walks barefoot"". 

Now, 17 years later, Daniel intends to return to the African continent to meet characters who marked his lens. About 40 photos taken in 2006 were selected. Each photo has a story. They are portraits of the most varied possible, which will act as guides that will dictate the progress of our itinerary in the village.

![](https://i.imgur.com/rjrMvLM.jpg)






![](https://i.imgur.com/2MG7rXs.jpg)

*What would it be like to meet the young Fatou N'Dei, now 20 years old?*

*What stories does she carry with her?*

*What was the village like for her at that time when you played in the rain?*

*What was your father's fate, Badou?*

*Did Fatou N'Dei follow the statistics and become a mother in her youth?*

![](https://i.imgur.com/js6EJen.jpg)


The aim of the project is to make an observational documentary, sometimes poetic, sometimes in the photo essay and at other times with backstage coverage, with a making-of behavior camera. A cross between these subgenres will bring harmonic diversity, as the raw material will always be the same: the past of the people and the village. In the footsteps of photographer Daniel Leite will be followed by a small team — which, with the necessary setback, will film these encounters. These same steps will be followed by the past, very closely with pictures the photographer produced in 2006. Whenever necessary, stories and images from the past will gain the screen, either by telling curiosities, or showing, through the contact sheet that will gain the canvas, the photographic step by step until the photo that he judged to be the main one.

# The legacy
![](https://i.imgur.com/zMhlAWP.jpg)


The Casamansa region is a conflagrated region, there is a separatist war there that has lasted more than 30 years. The young people of Kabadio are leaving the village for Europe, through illegal and very dangerous routes. Some manage to finish the path, but they are shocked by the illegality in Europe, others disappear.

The rural exodus is currently one of the biggest problems in the region and that is why the Permakabadio association works directly with young people in order to avoid choosing this path.

Among the countless activities offered by Permakabadio, it was in football that they found their greatest strength. Called Asc Bindoula, the association's team was created in order to develop the concept of youth belonging to a much larger context.

More than 20 athletes work hard throughout the year with the aim of classifying the team in the biggest competition in the state of Casamansa, Intervilarejos, the real World Cup in the region.

Taking place during Senegal's monsoon, one of the most difficult times of the year, where life becomes slow and all locomotion complex. Intervilarejo is a breather and a portal to a new competitive and festive reality.

[Permakabadio's Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permakabadio)

Our goal is to bring even more strength to the team and its athletes, so we want to sponsor the team next year through the following actions:

* Buy of a new uniform with Nouns as a sponsor
* Buy of sports equipment for the team (balls, cleats, shin guards…)
* Workshop with local experts, players, coaches.
* Renovation of the Kabadio football field
* Construction of ASC Bindoula's CT (Meeting and Study Room)
* Library around sports and decolonial themes
* Buy a laptop for the trainer
* Buy of a projector to be attached to the laptop for use in viewing games and tactics

All the amount raised with the release of the first feature was fully transferred to the village in the form of resources or support for projects.

![](https://i.imgur.com/AvhUsXB.jpg)



We facilitated the arrival of energy to the Bindoula permaculture farm, which today has 20 young people working directly in its operation. We helped in the construction of the Community Bakery located on the same farm, we donated half a ton of flour in order to speed up their bakery activities. In addition to donating food to the community and helping with emergencies in the village.

In this new project it will be no different, all the amount raised will be fully reverted to Kabadio and the maintenance of the legacy that Nouns will leave in the village.

# Why Nouns should fund this proposal

![](https://i.imgur.com/K1ZKVE5.jpg)


 “More past than future” talks about a people, a little visited part of Africa. Giving voice to its population is to bring out our ancestry, as it was from the Senegambia sector (where Kabadio is located) where the first Mandinga enslaved in the Africa x Brazil diasporic movement came from.

The potential of this project was already proven in our first feature, in which we were present in more than 40 film festivals, passing through 12 countries and remaining in the Amazon Prime Video documentary catalog for 2 years, being watched by more than 300k people worldwide.

Our bonds are not frivolous, our relationships are not ephemeral. We have followed the life of this village for more than 15 years and we intend to participate more and more in its development.

![](https://i.imgur.com/1qJC2Tf.jpg)


Sponsoring our documentary and book gives Nouns the opportunity to take their glasses into the most prestigious film festivals in the world, project their brand into the streaming universe, participate in an arts publication of historical importance and thereby affirm even more the strength of the community and its ability to be involved in big projects.

In addition to the public understanding the importance of Nouns in carrying out these artistic projects, they will understand that it was the initial vector for a legacy that belongs to the village. The films and the book make up an archive that will be entirely dedicated to the village's causes until the end of time.

Our cinema is humanitarian, all resources captured in this proposal will be donated to the village of Kabadio, located in the south of Senegal in the region of Casamance. Moving the local economy and leaving a true legacy for the people.

233,Nouns Acquisition Committee - delegation changes,"# Nouns Acquisition Committee - delegation changes

The Nouns Acquisition Committee (NAC) was established by Proposal 44, and has successfully acquired Nouns on behalf of the DAO for later distribution to builders as compensation.

The NAC Multisig (0x9298B97dE93784635900163e582A5D9e570f35a5) currently custodies 3 nouns in escrow on behalf of builders with approved but incomplete proposals. They are delegated to the Nouncil as specified in the original proposal.

These Nouns are collectively owned by the DAO. As Nouncil has grown and developed its own culture that is distinct from the greater NounsDAO, this delegation is no longer appropriate. 

This proposal instructs the NAC to:
1) delegate these Nouns to itself (0x9298B97dE93784635900163e582A5D9e570f35a5)
2) refrain from voting on future proposals.

Welcome to Nountown is an animated short film created via Prop 195 (in collaboration with 3dprintguy and Atrium) that will be released as a Timed Open Edition for a price of 0.0069 ETH. This means it will be available for anyone to mint for the specified minting period. The proceeds from sale will be split between Nouns DAO (60%) and Atrium (40%).

We are excited to further experiment with DAO NFT releases as an additional value capture mechanism, and potentially create a simple and repeatable model for any creator, community and brand in the ecosystem to put forward amazing artifacts to be minted via Nouns DAO.

This edition will be minted with Zora, and will be available to mint on-chain as well as at [thisisnouns.wtf](https://thisisnouns.wtf)

** Third time is the charm **

Welcome to Nountown is an animated short film created via Prop 195 (in collaboration with 3dprintguy and Atrium) that will be released as a Timed Open Edition for a price of 0.0069 ETH. This means it will be available for anyone to mint for the specified minting period. The proceeds from sale will be split between Nouns (60%) and Atrium (40%).

We are excited to experiment with DAO NFT releases as an additional value capture mechanism, and potentially create a simple and repeatable model for any creator, community and brand in the ecosystem to put forward amazing artifacts to be minted via Nouns DAO.

This edition will be minted with Zora, and will be available to mint on-chain as well as at [thisisnouns.wtf](https://thisisnouns.wtf)


### Release Details:
Title: 
Welcome to Nountown

Description: 
We now know the answer to WTF is a Noun, but the question of who the Nouns are still remains. 

""Welcome to Nountown"" serves as an introduction to the growing world of characters within the world of Nouns. 

Follow (Noun #1) through Nountown in a daring chase to ensure the Nounish glasses arrive at their destination, and build a foundation of future stories to come. Welcome to Nountown is the first in what we hope to be a series of Nounish adventures in created by Atrium and the community.

[Watch the trailer here](https://youtu.be/XNgY40Qk970)

The first short film funded by Nouns DAO (prop 20) is ready for its premiere, so we are proposing that Nouns DAO launch the film with a premiere and timed open edition mint event, all in one, via this proposal.

While it will be either the second or third ever DAO mint (depending on outcomes of current proposals), it will be the first ever DAO release of media (premiere) via a proposal. Upon execution, the mint and film will both be available here: [premiere.wtf](http://premiere.wtf/)

_______________

The Wizards Hat has been a labor of love from its genesis to completion. Every aspect of the film from early pre-production art through to voice overs, sound design and animation has been toiled over, aiming to uphold a long-established artisan approach of traditional animation. The team has enjoyed every little step of the journey and we hope watching it is as magical as it has been making it.

We ended up writing a long form breakdown of Harriett - a bubbly wizard’s hat who always sees the cauldron half-full, and Grummelot - a grumpy old spellmaster stuck in his ways. An origin story and full season arcs are ready to be turned into a full animated series if the opportunity arises.

______________

[Prop 190](https://nouns.wtf/vote/190) described an idea, that ""by minting... from the DAO via a proposal, it is becoming Nouns DAO canon. Similar to how the DAO added in new head attributes via a proposal, Nouns can continue to explore and experiment with new models of CC0 art and production and minting directly from the DAO is a new tool for the organization to directly release and distribute the most important artifacts from the community. It’s not hard to see how this can advance Nouns into a crypto-native form of Movie Studio, Production House, Art Museum and so on.""

The film will be released as a timed open edition for a price of 0.05 ETH. This means it will be available for anyone to mint for the premiere week, which will be approximately the 20th Feb - 27th Feb, (beginning from proposal execution). Proceeds from sale will be split between Nouns DAO and the Wizards Hat production team 50/50.

Again, we echo the sentiment of [prop 190](https://nouns.wtf/vote/190): ""We are excited to experiment with DAO NFT releases as an additional value capture mechanism, and potentially create a simple and repeatable model for any creator, community and brand in the ecosystem to put forward amazing artifacts to be minted via Nouns.""

This edition will be minted with [Zora](https://zora.co/), and will be available to mint onchain as well as watch the film at [premiere.wtf](http://premiere.wtf/) after the proposal is executed.

Find out more about what we've been up to here: [twitter.com/nouns_stories](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories)

Note: the Zora edition has been setup with the film's trailer as a placeholder, and will be swapped out to the final film upon execution, before transferring the contract ownership to the DAO.

Welcome to Nountown is an animated short film created via Prop 195 (in collaboration with 3dprintguy and Atrium) that will be released as a Timed Open Edition for a price of 0.0069 ETH. This means it will be available for anyone to mint for the specified minting period. The proceeds from sale will be split between Nouns (60%) and Atrium (40%).

We echo what was said in Prop 190. We are excited to experiment with DAO NFT releases as an additional value capture mechanism, and potentially create a simple and repeatable model for any creator, community and brand in the ecosystem to put forward amazing artifacts to be minted via Nouns DAO.

This edition will be minted with [Zora](https://zora.co), and will be available to mint onchain as well as at [atrium.art/nountown](https://atrium.art/nountown)

Note: URL will redirect to a drop page once the drop is live.

### Release Details:
Title: 
Welcome to Nountown

Description: 
We now know the answer to WTF is a Noun, but the question of who the Nouns are still remains. 

""Welcome to Nountown"" serves as an introduction to the growing world of characters within the world of Nouns. 

Follow (Noun #1) through Nountown in a daring chase to ensure the Nounish glasses arrive at their destination, and build a foundation of future stories to come. Welcome to Nountown is the first in what we hope to be a series of Nounish adventures created by Atrium and the community.

238,Functional Props,"# Functional Props

# TLDR

1. Finish development, testing and deploy a generalized NFT random distributor which enables any proposer to propose distribution of current or future NFTs in our Treasury. The distributor makes use of new tech I call “functional props”; meaning the prop itself determines how many NFTs to distribute at execution time as a function of the prop’s vote counts.
2. Develop, test, audit and deploy a contract that enables proposers to ask for functional funding. Functional funding allows proposers to suggest a funding range within which they are willing to execute a prop. The actual funding amount received is determined by the prop’s vote counts.

# Why Functional Props?

*Cool tech, cool experiment. But how is it useful?*

For both NFT distribution and funding it’s a more efficient way of achieving “middle ground”; a form of consensus.

Think about it as a way of taking an on-chain average of all opinions.

The current alternative is an attention-deprived off-chain back and forth between proponent and community to arrive at a proposal price point or distribution number.

This [back and forth I had with Gami](https://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil/status/1622308820658651139) goes deeper. An extract:

### What stops people from just setting the lower threshold to their ideal amount and upper threshold as buffer?

If you set the lower threshold to ideal amount you increase the risk of the prop not passing vs a vanilla prop ceteris paribus.

### As for the thresholds, how would voters know that proposer set their levels in such a way?

Voters will know the range of funding. When voting, you know that if there is intense support, the prop will hit the upper part of the range. If it barely passes, it will hit the lower part.

You base your vote on that.

If you feel comfortable with the funding range, you vote FOR. The more people feel comfortable with the range, the higher the funding.

It gives quadratic funding vibes.

### When put like that it feels like it would alleviate some of the anxiety around voting too. Like sharing the load in a clever way. Nice.

Right. Well put. Like smoothing out the noise in a signal with a moving average filter.

# Phase 1: Generalized NFT Distributor

Before functional funding comes functional NFT distribution.

I am the dev and proposer behind [Prop 199](https://nouns.wtf/vote/199) which passed 226 : 9. Prop 199 was a successful experiment to distribute 50 Nouns Vision Glasses from our Treasury to Nouners at random.

I have developed (inspect code [here](https://github.com/0xDigitalOil/nouns-props/tree/master/GeneralizedNFTDistributor)) a generalized version of the Nouns Vision Glasses distributor that allows for any proposer to propose random distribution of any ERC-721 in our Treasury to Nouners. This included development of a generalized version of the BatchTransfer contract [9999.⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999) deployed for [Prop 185](https://nouns.wtf/vote/185).

As this deployment is not a one-off and meant to be a primitive the DAO can leverage at any time, plus the code is more complex, it requires more extensive testing. In addition, it requires a more complex custom front-end for the distribution claims.

## Functional Distribution

The generalized NFT distributor has a new distribution mechanism baked in that allows the proposer to set the maximum number of NFTs to distribute. Then, if the prop passes, at execution time, the distribution contract calculates the number of NFTs to randomly distribute as a function of the vote (for, against, abstain) counts.

The proposer also selects the distribution amount calculation mechanism. This code extract shows the possible distribution rules the proposer can select from:

![Proposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.](https://i.ibb.co/Gthy2Nj/Untitled.png)

Proposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.

For example, the proposer might want to propose a distribution of some LilNouns in the treasury. The proposer is unsure of how many LilNouns the DAO is willing to distribute so he/she selects VotesFor as the distribution mechanism. Thus, the higher “For Vote” turnout (the more popular the prop was), the more LilNouns will be distributed. 

## Prop Execution

Here’s how proposing and execution works:

![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/nn33yHB/Untitled-1.png)

# Phase 2: Functional Funding

I call “functional props” proposals that are self-referential at prop execution time. Initially I’m interested in exploring props that use vote counts (i.e., how many for/against/abstain) as inputs and take actions as a function of those inputs. We could imagine going beyond that to enable props that pull from a larger voter input-space such as vote reasons*.

Functional funding is a subset of functional props that enables an efficient way for the DAO to price proposals. The mechanism works as follows:

1. Proposer writes a prop where he/she proposes to do some work for Nouns DAO.
2. The proposer sets the prop transaction to call the FunctionalFunding contract and selects a funding range (e.g. 30-50 ETH) and distribution rule. This signals to the DAO that he/she is willing to do the work for a minimum of 30 ETH, but if the DAO as a whole signals that it values the work being done greatly (via strong FOR support), the proposer will get funded more than 30 ETH, up to 50 ETH.
3. If the prop passes, when it executes it references itself, reading its vote counts to determine the funding amount according to the distribution rule.
4. FunctionalFunding contract sends the calculated amount of ETH.

![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/bgPmDV1/Untitled-2.png)

## What does this solve?

For Proposers:

- Allows the proposer to do an all-in-one price discovery by “polling” all voters on-chain
- Lower probability of good proposals being rejected due to mere price → avoids going back, adjusting price and resubmitting

For Voters:

- Decision is less stressful as it’s less binary. You can be OK with the prop content and range and “delegate” price decision to the rest of the voters

For Nouns DAO:

- All-in-one prop voting and efficient price discovery
- Proposals are more likely to be funded closer to “fair price” than the current binary funding mechanism

# Deliverables

1. Trustless, immutable primitive contract-set that allow Nouners to propose random distribution of NFTs, where the final number of NFTs distributed is a function of proposal popularity.
2. Front-end for claiming NFTs of said distribution rounds. Allows for multiple distribution rounds per NFT collection.
3. Trustless, immutable primitive contract that allow Nouners to create proposals that are funded within a range as a function of proposal popularity.

# Ask

![](https://i.imgur.com/TeIUlxa.png)

‘Nouns: Nountown’ will be released in April of 2023, but the size of the print run will be determined by aggregate demand at the end of February. To ensure maximum distribution of the comic, we propose that NounsDAO purchase and warehouse 5000 copies of each issue. Based on the best estimate of industry veteran Adam Fortier, the print run for each edition will be ~20,000 copies, giving the DAO approximately ¼ of the supply. ComicsDAO on behalf of NounsDAO will store the books in a warehouse in Maryland, a hub that can ship books to individuals, groups, or stores as they run out of stock.

Additionally, ‘Nouns: Nountown’ will be presented at Comicon San Diego and New York. These are the two largest events in comics, and we will bring copies of ‘Nouns: Nountown’ for the artist to sign at the convention, as well as copies to sell at the convention.

NounsDAO (via ComicsDAO) will be able to accept orders through Titan Comics for fulfilment around the world, and ComicsDAO will set up an e-mail address for those that wish to use ETH or USDC to purchase books, with the proceeds going back into the Nouns Treasury as the comics are sold. Anyone that wants a book will be able to get one (until the stock is depleted).

Terms

Each issue is $5 USD, with 5,000 copies costing $25,000 USD. For 6 issues, that’s $150,000 USD, paid in USDC. Funds will be sent to the ComicsDAO/SharkDAO multisig from Prop 116.

**TLDR**: Aggregating and organizing data from  applications, and making it open source and composable. The aggregated data will be published in a decentralized database and accessible through a GraphQL API.

**Goal**: Our goal is to make it easier for people to use and control their data in the Nouniverse. We'll use [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/) and decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to achieve this, allowing data to flow more easily between different applications in the network. This will help solve issues with scattered/fragmented data and make it more easily available to everyone. We'll also establish a universal identity system to make it easier for different applications to share the same user account. Ultimately, we're working to create a reliable and efficient decentralized network that provides a better experience for users.

![Qm-Toek-X1-Fsy-Dp-PXPn3mi-KPCns-VHy-Z6-H1-Pmka-A5qz4p-TVDj.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/T1Sn4xgM/Qm-Toek-X1-Fsy-Dp-PXPn3mi-KPCns-VHy-Z6-H1-Pmka-A5qz4p-TVDj.jpg)
-   **What is the platform's function?** The platform can store and manage large amounts of data for decentralized protocols, allowing developers to easily create new applications that build upon existing data and contribute to the data graph.
    
- **What are the key benefits of the platform?** The platform enables innovative applications and user experiences, reduces data and application fragmentation, increases data sovereignty, facilitates integration and development, and improves interoperability and composability among participating applications.
    
-   **What problems are being addressed?** Universal identity, data and application fragmentation, data availability, and data composability.

-   **Why can’t Ethereum be used to store the data?** “Ethereum itself can be used as a decentralized storage system, and it is when it comes to code storage in all the smart contracts. However, when it comes to large amounts of data, that isn't what Ethereum was designed for. The chain is steadily growing, but at the time of writing, the Ethereum chain is around 500GB - 1TB (depending on the client), and every node on the network needs to be able to store all of the data. If the chain were to expand to large amounts of data (say 5TBs) it wouldn't be feasible for all nodes to continue to run. Also, the cost of deploying this much data to Mainnet would be prohibitively expensive due to gas fees.” - [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/bg/developers/docs/storage/)


-   **Why is this platform preferable to IPFS, or similar solutions currently available in the market?**  We'll be using [ComposeDB](https://composedb.js.org/), which leverages Ceramic, a mutable layer for IPFS with anchoring on Ethereum for finality. By using Ceramic, the Nounish platform is able to provide faster data retrieval and processing, as well as advanced data management tools such as decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that enable greater control and ownership over data.

## Problem Statement
As the DAO grows, people must navigate an environment that is increasingly fragmented. The data produced by many small and large applications are scattered, siloed and inconsistent in format and structure, making it difficult for users to access and utilize. This fragmentation lowers the accessibility, usability, and value of the data, and limits the potential insights and innovations that can be gained from it.

  

In addition, only a small subset of all data in the Nouniverse is stored on-chain, which can create challenges for developers and users who need to access and use this data. In a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), data is a critical asset that drives decision-making, governance, and value creation. Therefore, it is important for a DAO to have a decentralized data network like Ceramic that provides users with greater control and ownership of their data, and enables interoperability and composability of data across different applications, including off-chain data.

  
**Vision**: In a future wherein permissionless data collaboration achieves critical mass within the DAO, users would have unprecedented control and ownership over their data, with the ability to easily share and reuse it across different participating applications. The decentralized nature of Ceramic would ensure that data is stored securely and efficiently, without the risk of censorship or centralization. The interoperability and composability enabled by Ceramic would lead to a proliferation of innovative and user-centric applications, breaking down the barriers that currently exist between different platforms and ecosystems. The benefits of this future would extend beyond just the technical members of the DAO, as all users would be able to take advantage of the seamless and intuitive interfaces enabled by the data network. The adoption of Ceramic would be a major step towards a more open and equitable internet, where data is treated as a commons to be shared and nurtured, rather than a commodity to be monetized and controlled.

## Objectives
-   To create a decentralized data network and database that can make it easier for people to access, understand and use data in the Nouniverse.
-   To give people more control and ownership over their data through the use of decentralized identifiers (DIDs).
-   To make it possible for different applications to share and use data, creating new possibilities for how data can be used.
-   To provide developers with access to a permissionless data layer, which includes information on governance, funding, and user activity for the DAO.
-   To make it easy for developers to integrate with and build on top of the data that the DAO has collected.
-   To enable developers to tap into the network effects of the DAO by allowing their applications to connect and interact with each other.
-   To enable a more open and equitable internet where data is treated as a shared resource rather than a commodity that can be controlled and monetized.

## Deliverables - 3 Month Timeline
To achieve these objectives, we will deliver the following components: infrastructure, applications, and services.

**Infrastructure**: The infrastructure component involves deploying a Ceramic network node that runs an instance of ComposeDB, a decentralized, composable graph database. This node will serve the applications, which can read and write data permissionlessly (subject to data ownership constraints). The raw data backing this database is stored in IPFS. In order to bootstrap application use cases, relevant on-chain and off-chain data will be imported, processed and stored into ComposeDB. The data will be attributed with relationships for composability and made available via a GraphQL API.

**Applications**: Three applications will be deployed on the Ceramic network by the core team upon completion.

-   **NounsID** - The identity interface for the Nouniverse. A user profile for participants of the Nouns ecosystem, composed of user-owned properties and relationships to data from sources such as on-chain proposals and votes, PropHouse, Snapshot and Discourse. The user-owned profile allows the user to control their represented identity, linking it to social media accounts, setting up their preferences and carrying them across application built atop the decentralized data layer.
    
-   **Builder Profile** - Builder profiles (nounish cv) are meant to give a full picture of a nounish builder's contributions to the Nouniverse, leveraging data aggregated from NounID, stored on the decentralized data layer.
    
-   **Noundry** - Will integrate with the Ceramic network, leveraging its decentralized datastore, and our universal identity (NounsID). Noundry Ceramic Integration may include but are not limited by the following features:
    
    -  Upload your traits once, use it all across the ecosystem! - Create your artist profile and keep your own provenance records - Include metadata with your artwork. Give it name & context.
    - Remix & collab on everything, powered by CC0 Some ideas of integrations to harness this data: 
    - Noundry contests, to sign up your traits and try to make them into official Nouns traits. 
    - Builder DAO, to boot a new DAO with Nounish artwork using a collection of existing traits. 
    - Noun DAO UIs, to show tooltips over the Nouns with more info about the traits and their artists
    - Other features to explore: cross-dao artwork compatibility by mapping out trait categories, templates, sizes & color palettes - Scraping of existing artwork and contacting artists to seed their profiles - Offering the artwork in multiple formats (svg, png) for better compatibility with different applications


**Services**: 
- Throughout development, the team will provide weekly Q&A during office hours, hosted by The Noun Square. 
- The team will provide a JavaScript library that makes it easy for front-end applications to query and deploy their own data. 
- Finally, we will collaborate with AI Pod, providing the processed and formatted data relevant for training their models.

## Deliverables:
**Infrastructure Component:**
-   **Nounish decentralized database**: We'll run a Ceramic and ComposeDB node that serves the data through a GraphQL API.
- **Scrape/ingest real Nouns data sources**: Collect PropHouse, on-chain, Snapshot and Discourse data in near real-time, so that apps can query and compose them through our service.
- **Client library for easy integration**: Provide a JavaScript library that client applications can use to easily query and publish data.
- **Nouner preferences:** Deploy a Preferred proposal categories, optional social links, preferred Noun profile image and other .
- **Support and/or integrate with partners and application developers**: Work with the community to brainstorm on new and existing models and incorporate feedback.
    
>**Note**: Part of this work has been started with 15k USD subsidized by the Ceramic builder grants.


**Application Component:**
-   **1st Party, Core Applications:** NounsID
- **3rd Party, Nounish Partner Integrations:** Noundry Integration and Builder Profile

**Services Component:**
-   Provide ingested, and formatted data for AI Pod
-   Provide developers with APIs and a library to leverage permissionless, composable databases as a service.
-   Q&A with developers during regularly scheduled office hours on The Noun Square.

## Success Criteria

-   **Uptime**: Functional network with availability on-par with centralized databases.
-   **Integrations**: Successful integration with launch partner - Noundry.
-  **Composability**: One or more demonstrable (ideally novel) composable and interoperable application use cases from pre-existing applications in the Nouns ecosystem.
-   **Partnerships**: Number of pre-existing nounish applications that commit, and follow through with network integrations in the ecosystem that leverage the network.
- **Data Sources**: Amount of data sources integrated, and CRUD operations executed on Ceramic.

## Future Work

-   Expand data sources to eventually include all relevant data generated in the Nouniverse and make it permissionless and composable, along with publishing relevant metadata from applications running on the network.
-   Create developer tools, documentation, and examples to make development easier for developers.
-   Partnerships: Coordinate with Voters.wtf, Federation, Lil Nouns mainsite, and Apache SuperSet(Nouns Metrics), for potential network integration.

241,Functional Props (Take 2),"# Functional Props (Take 2)

New text has been `highlighted` for easier differentiation between this prop and Prop 238.

# TLDR

1. `This is a resubmission of Prop 238, with a better explainer of the pros taking into account feedback, including two additional deliverables (and a bit higher ask for this reason).`
2. Finish development, testing and deploy a generalized NFT random distributor which enables any proposer to propose distribution of current or future NFTs in our Treasury. The distributor makes use of new tech I call “functional props”; meaning the prop itself determines how many NFTs to distribute at execution time as a function of the prop’s vote counts. `Now includes a Pull Request into the nouns.wtf front-end to allow for a better UX when proposing NFT distributions.`
3. Develop, test, audit and deploy a contract that enables proposers to ask for functional funding. Functional funding allows proposers to suggest a funding range within which they are willing to execute a prop. The actual funding amount received is determined by the prop’s vote counts. `Now includes a Pull Request into the nouns.wtf front-end to allow for better UX when proposing range or milestone funding.`

# Why Functional Props?

*Cool tech, cool experiment. But how is it useful?*

`Historically, all DAO proposals have had binary outcomes (pass or fail). The time has come to invent tooling for DAOs to allow for non-binary outcomes on votes, and for Nouns to lead the way on this.`

`Take Prop 239 (comic book purchase) as an example. The DAO could be in agreement that it makes sense to purchase comic books, but not necessarily 5,000 of them. If the prop’s voting outcome were non-binary, the DAO would have had a way to simultaneously decide if it makes sense, and also how many comic books to print. Maybe the prop wouldn’t have had to be canceled.`

For both NFT distribution and funding it’s a more efficient way of achieving “middle ground”; a form of consensus.

Think about it as a way of taking an on-chain average of all opinions.

The current alternative is an attention-deprived off-chain back and forth between proponent and community to arrive at a proposal price point or distribution number.

# `Past props where functional props would have been useful`

`Prop 236: Wizard’s Hat — determine the mint price of our NFT together at vote time, from a range.`

`Prop 223: House of Nouns — Implement milestones instead of all or nothing.  Milestones are mapped to voting tiers. The more popular the prop is at vote time, more funding is sent and more features get implemented.`

`Prop 217: Stake an additional 5,000 ETH in LIDO — instead stake between 1,000-5,000 depending on the level of support for the prop.`

`Prop 206: Nouns on the Ground 2023 — Do tiered funding (5, 10, or 15 IRL events) instead of all or nothing.`

`Prop 202: nouns.eth set reverse record — in addition to executing, do we also send 1 ETH to Jacob? Depending on the popularity of the prop, we send between 0-1ETH.`

`Prop 184: Nouns funding ZachXBT — fund within range 50-100 ETH, instead of all or nothing.`

`Prop 167: Nouns Builder — seed the Builder treasury within a range (e.g. 500-1,000 ETH).`

`Prop 125: 8/8 anniversary art — only change existing traits if the vote is unanimous.*`

# `Answers to common doubts on functional funding`

### `What if a proposer that is willing to do work for 30 ETH proposes a range of 30-50 ETH to squeeze out more from the DAO?`

`A proposer is disincentivized to do so, as it increases the likelihood of the prop being defeated. It could also be argued conversely, that if functional funding wasn’t possible, the proposer could have proposed an all-or-nothing 50 ETH instead of a range where the DAO could save money if the prop passes, but barely. We can’t be certain if functional funding will make overall payouts larger or smaller, but we can be sure that funds will be allocated more efficiently as more granularity allows for concentrating capital where it needs to be.`

### `If I support a proposal getting the lower part of the range, but not the upper part, how am I supposed to decide how to vote before the very last second?`

`Granted that this is a tricky aspect of functional funding. I give a two-part answer:`

`1. The question doesn’t apply to all props where functional funding could be useful. For example, take the hypothetical use for Prop 217 (staking in LIDO). If you are OK with staking 5,000 ETH, you are OK with staking 1,000. In this case, you it doesn’t really matter to you if you vote early or later. If you aren’t comfortable with staking up to 5,000 ETH, you vote against. You would have voted against Prop 217 in its non-functional funding incarnation anyway.`
`2. Granted that those who vote later have more information than those who vote earlier. However, those that vote earlier likely are OK with the entire range. Those that vote later will have more influence over the outcome. This is a net positive: a. those who are OK with the entire range are happy. b. those who want to control the range, can do so by voting later.`

### `Even though the tech is innovative, I don’t see it being widely adopted`

`Refer to the section above where I highlight some use cases that make Nouns a more agile decision-making DAO.`

### `The main mechanics of the DAO should stick to the KISS principle`

`The concern is that it should be made as simple as possible for Nouners to vote. I agree that simpler is better. Most props will not make use of functional funding and will stick to KISS. However, for those that it makes sense to make outcomes functional, if it’s more efficient for the DAO, it’s worth the marginal complexity.`

# Phase 1: Generalized NFT Distributor

Before functional funding comes functional NFT distribution.

I am the dev and proposer behind [Prop 199](https://nouns.wtf/vote/199) which passed 226 : 9. Prop 199 was a successful experiment to distribute 50 Nouns Vision Glasses from our Treasury to Nouners at random.

I have developed (inspect code [here](https://github.com/0xDigitalOil/nouns-props/tree/master/GeneralizedNFTDistributor)) a generalized version of the Nouns Vision Glasses distributor that allows for any proposer to propose random distribution of any ERC-721 in our Treasury to Nouners. This included development of a generalized version of the BatchTransfer contract [9999.⌐◨-◨](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999) deployed for [Prop 185](https://nouns.wtf/vote/185).

As this deployment is not a one-off and meant to be a primitive the DAO can leverage at any time, plus the code is more complex, it requires more extensive testing. In addition, it requires a more complex custom front-end for the distribution claims.

## `Why do we need a generalized NFT distributor?`

`The Nouns DAO treasury continues to hoard NFTs as subDAOs such as Lil Nouns and Nouns Builder are “paying backwards” in the form of governance tokens.`

`It is likely that as the Nouns meme proliferates, more and more subDAOs will continue to do the same.`

`Historically, we haven’t used these NFTs to govern these subDAOs and to this date haven’t reached consensus as to whether it’s something we are interested in doing as a DAO.`

`There is no point in having NFTs in our treasury that we don’t plan on using. If we are to go down the alternate path, who better than Nouners to receive them and participate in subDAO governance in an individual, more decentralized manner.`

## Functional Distribution

The generalized NFT distributor has a new distribution mechanism baked in that allows the proposer to set the maximum number of NFTs to distribute. Then, if the prop passes, at execution time, the distribution contract calculates the number of NFTs to randomly distribute as a function of the vote (for, against, abstain) counts.

The proposer also selects the distribution amount calculation mechanism. This code extract shows the possible distribution rules the proposer can select from:

![Proposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.](https://i.ibb.co/Gthy2Nj/Untitled.png)

Proposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.

For example, the proposer might want to propose a distribution of some LilNouns in the treasury. The proposer is unsure of how many LilNouns the DAO is willing to distribute so he/she selects VotesFor as the distribution mechanism. Thus, the higher “For Vote” turnout (the more popular the prop was), the more LilNouns will be distributed. 

## Prop Execution

Here’s how proposing and execution works:

![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/nn33yHB/Untitled-1.png)

# Phase 2: Functional Funding

I call “functional props” proposals that are self-referential at prop execution time. Initially I’m interested in exploring props that use vote counts (i.e., how many for/against/abstain) as inputs and take actions as a function of those inputs. We could imagine going beyond that to enable props that pull from a larger voter input-space such as vote reasons*.

Functional funding is a subset of functional props that enables an efficient way for the DAO to price proposals. The mechanism works as follows:

1. Proposer writes a prop where he/she proposes to do some work for Nouns DAO.
2. The proposer sets the prop transaction to call the FunctionalFunding contract and selects a funding range (e.g. 30-50 ETH) and distribution rule. This signals to the DAO that he/she is willing to do the work for a minimum of 30 ETH, but if the DAO as a whole signals that it values the work being done greatly (via strong FOR support), the proposer will get funded more than 30 ETH, up to 50 ETH.
3. If the prop passes, when it executes it references itself, reading its vote counts to determine the funding amount according to the distribution rule.
4. FunctionalFunding contract sends the calculated amount of ETH.

![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/bgPmDV1/Untitled-2.png)

## What does this solve?

For Proposers:

- Allows the proposer to do an all-in-one price discovery by “polling” all voters on-chain
- Lower probability of good proposals being rejected due to mere price → avoids going back, adjusting price and resubmitting

For Voters:

- Decision is less stressful as it’s less binary. You can be OK with the prop content and range and “delegate” decision of the price point to the rest of the voters

For Nouns DAO:

- All-in-one prop voting and efficient price discovery
- Proposals are more likely to be funded closer to “fair price” than the current binary funding mechanism
- `For the first time, allows the DAO to vote on proposals that need to pass unanimously to execute`

1. Trustless, immutable primitive contract-set that allow Nouners to propose random distribution of NFTs, where the final number of NFTs distributed is a function of proposal popularity.
2. Front-end for claiming NFTs of said distribution rounds. Allows for multiple distribution rounds per NFT collection.
3. Trustless, immutable primitive contract that allow Nouners to create proposals that are funded within a range as a function of proposal popularity.
4. `UI on [nouns.wtf](http://nouns.wtf) similar to the USDC converter, that allows proposers to select and input parameters for functional NFT distributions or funding.`

# `Positive feedback on Prop 238`

**`The innovative approach to Human Organization presented here is a promising addition to the Nouns toolkit, which continues to lead the way with innovative public goods. I support the continued exploration of fresh governance approaches, such as the ""Function Props"" concept, which can leverage the benefits of large group decision-making.`**

**`I'm in favor of experimenting to find better mechanisms we can use to reach non-binary outcomes for proposals and for that reason I'm voting in favor. Even if this isn't used much or is used and we discover what the shortcoming is, that would be a plus in my book.`**

**`I think that it is important for the DAO to continue to explore new ways to use governance to resolve conflict, and I see ""Function Props"" as a promising direction here. They could offer a way to take advantage of the concave decision making advantage of large groups: where any point along the spectrum from 0 to 1 is higher value than either a 0 or 1 outcome.`**

**`innovative price discovery`**

**`Great way to put the NFTs in the treasury to work!`**

**`Sounds like this can be implemented, so I'm in full support. More than reasonable cost.`**

**`Digitaloil is demonstrably dedicated, creative and aligned with Nouns long term and wants to try and build a useful Nounish primitive.  Let's see how he impresses.`**

**`i think the cost is fair, and it could also lead to new ideas to improve or offer alternatives to the current proposal constraints.`**

**`Nounish dev building nounish things - hopefully having funding methods like this save the dao money in the long term`**

**`nounishly positive`**

**`The range funding is the killer app here imo. Gives proposers with that flexibility the option to potentially get more vote support than a fixed rate.`**

# Ask

`38` ETH sent to me, [DigitalOil](https://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil). 

If only I could propose a functional funding range 🤷‍♂️.

### Funding breakdown

1. 15 ETH — finish testing of NFT Distributor contracts. Develop generalized claim front-end.
2. 20 ETH — Develop functional funding contract, including contract audit.
3. `3 ETH — Pull requests into [nouns.wtf](http://nouns.wtf) front-end for a better UX and reduce friction when proposers choose to submit a functional prop instead of a binary prop.`

*Note that using vote reasons as inputs to functional props would require a change to the governance contract as vote reasons are currently not introspectable at execution time.",ACTIVE,16735985,16771985,1,93,,1000000,1000,1500,624,107,128,0,['38000000000000000000'],['0xaec4075e4fc8ce829bc4f0cfd5e2fa10dd2b12d1'],[''],16699985,1677263495,0x27749daa0b75d210aad14b375898d42e82565afbfaaf52875847f137619d386c,['0x'],0xaec4075e4fc8ce829bc4f0cfd5e2fa10dd2b12d1

![Proposal Lifecycle](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Proposal+Lifecycle+Small.gif)

This is a shortened version of our proposal. [**Read the full proposal and Q&A here.**](https://www.notion.so/collectivexyz/House-of-Nouns-v2-final-revision-97873114f37141b6995116178a76df00?pvs=4)

# Tl;dr
We’re seeking 95 ETH of funding to continue developing House of Nouns for the next five months. Our goal is to expand House of Nouns from an MVP for voting into a full suite of tools that enables proposers and voters with an ideas board, drafts, feedback, Nounish integrations, and more places for discussion.

Most importantly: We will open source the end product, so anyone can host, build on top of, and monetize the deliverables in this proposal. Nouns will have permanent access to House of Nouns via the open source infrastructure.

*This is our third and final revision for House of Nouns. We have reduced the original budget by ~60% in USD, from 340 ETH ($420,000) to 95 ETH ($160,000). [Read the full proposal.](https://www.notion.so/collectivexyz/House-of-Nouns-v2-final-revision-97873114f37141b6995116178a76df00?pvs=4)*

*Visit [houseofnouns.wtf](https://houseofnouns.wtf) to view our current MVP.*

# Mission
Improve Nouns governance by empowering Nouns to contribute, find consensus before going onchain, and vote confidently.

# Why open source?
Primarily, open source ensures that House of Nouns will always be able to exist, regardless of any future funding. This creates public infrastructure for DAO governance that can be used by anyone, forever, funded by Nouns.

Additionally, there is no centralized value capture for [Collective](https://twitter.com/collectivexyz) (the company building House of Nouns) or anyone else. Anyone and everyone can build on top of it.

We believe the open-source, permissionless approach is inline with the ethos of Nouns, versus the alternative of closed-source, licensing of the product, subscriptions, or advertising.

# With 20 ETH from Prop House, we’ve…
- Created an MVP used by ~26% of Nouns (incl. holders, proposers, & delegates)
- Over 100% month-over-month growth (MAUs & views)
- Fostered proposal discussion that is nowhere else
- Become a go-to client for voting and discussion

# Deliverables
These are the deliverables we’ll guarantee to build over the next five months. We move quickly, and we’re excited to go above-and-beyond where applicable.

### Pre-proposal Drafts Client
- Goal: Makes the pre-proposal process public and collaborative.
- Proposal drafts & versions, saving time with tedious markdown editing & feedback
- Proposal templates 
- Inline commenting with ETH identities 
- Public revisions 
- One-click promote to onchain 

### Ideas Client
- Goal: Post early stage ideas, generate support, and promote to a draft.
- Reddit-like platform for voting on ideas
- Upvoting and commenting tied to ETH identities
- One-click promote to draft or “looking for sponsor”

### Open-source Infrastructure
- Goal: Eliminate barriers to building on Nouns governance, and allow anyone to self-host 
- API for all governance, discussion, profiles, etc.
- Open source repository
- Technical docs

### Public good for all Nounish DAOs
- Feed for activity across your DAOs
- See to-dos and notifications across DAOs
- Support for all Nouns forks

### Integration of Nounish tools
- We will use building blocks from the Nouns ecosystem where possible
- Some ideas include but are not limited to: 
- Prop House voting 
- Agora delegate profiles
- Federation DAO-to-DAO governance
- Nouns AI pod summaries & context
- Nouns Atlas search

# Budget
We’re requesting **95 ETH for 5 months** for full-time development work from a team of four developers — or ~5 ETH/developer/month. After revising our proposal and speaking with numerous members of the community, we believe this is fair and in line with standard service development costs.

We believe this budget is easily justified for deliverables that will positively impact decentralization, participation, and decision-making.

### **What**

This is a proposal to build an ideas marketplace for Nouns.

### **Goals**

1. make it easier for ideas and builders to be considered by the DAO.
2. make it easier for Nouners to signal what they want to see done and funded.

### **How**

The marketplace will separate ideas from proposals. This establishes an inconsequential touchpoint between builders and the treasury before the decision to fund or reject.

Doing so will unlock the following for Nouns, and eventually the wider ecosystem:

- More ideas being generated because the process of submitting an idea is less consequential / arduous than a carefully considered proposal.
- Establishes a contribution portal for those who may not want to build, but have ideas.
- Ability to replace Discourse with a Reddit like portal for each idea and its proposals.
- Ideas can be evaluated on their own merit, without bias towards a proposer or execution.
- Ideas can be revisited, refined and developed over time, potentially leading to better proposals in the future.
- Recognition and potentially compensation for idea creators, despite not being involved in the execution of the proposal.
- Larger pool of potential builders to propose their executions, leading to more aligned proposals and better outcomes for the DAO.

### **UX**

1. Anyone can submit an idea to Prop Lot. 
2. Nouners show support for ideas through token weighted up/down voting.
3. Ideas with X amount of upvotes (% threshold decided by DAO) are added to Nouns DAO’s Prop Lot page to start accepting proposals from builders.
4. Nouners can up/down vote proposals. Nouners can also suggest changes. If not supportive of an ETH ask, Nouners can submit an ETH amount they would support onchain. 
5. Proposals with X amount upvotes (% threshold decided by DAO) will be able to be pushed onchain at Nouns DAO for funding.

Nouners can also request proposals or a temp-check directly from Nouns DAO’s Prop Lot page.

### **Deliverables**

- Built an instance of Lil Nouns' Prop Lot for Nouns as a POC (for free. not part of this proposal). Submit your ideas at [nouns.proplot.wtf](https://nouns.proplot.wtf/)
- Idea marketplace released on per feature basis where possible, replacing the POC.
- Working closely with Verbs team to ensure smooth integration with Nouns DAO V3 governance upgrades.
- Expected development time of 12 weeks, with extra time dedicated to actioning feedback, making improvements and feature explorations with the community.
- API so other front end clients can pull ideas to make it easier for anyone to see the ideas Nouners want funded.
- Entirely open source.

### **If successful, what’s next?**

- Explore features that improve Nouners’ ability to make informed decisions about proposals: Eg, a portal for public sourced sentiment to add context in areas Nouners may not be familiar with (potentially activating Nouns spectators).
- Look to integrate Prop House as a funding destination proposals can be pushed to (eg, Prop House Infinite rounds).
- Submit → Submint: consider moving the marketplace onchain to give the DAO control over it’s Prop Lot page, let other Nounish DAOs self-onboard and create an incentive structure that encourages idea submissions (eg, provenance and idea contribution tip).

### Tl;dr:
After the success of [Prop 195](https://nouns.wtf/vote/195) and the release of the [Nountown animated short film](https://twitter.com/AtriumNft/status/1622726466948694018) we made, we are proposing Nouns engage with Atrium to continually produce a series of episodic content via consecutive proposals. When this content is pieced together retroactively - all of the cinematic content will be able to be binged as a single movie / series. Atrium creatives will write and create the content which will be split up among story acts.

This specific prop is funding a pilot delivered at the end of 90 days. Detailed below are the steps involved in exploring different visual styles, additional deliverables and ultimately making the Pilot content. 

After the pilot is revealed in 90 days, the DAO will decide if it wants to move forward in funding more of the whole film.

---
### Proposal Ask:
**125,000 USD for a time-period of 90 days**

- Pre-production & character development
- Script for the Pilot (3.5 mins) / ACT 1 + Summaries of all subsequent acts - delivered at 90 days
- Animated Teaser with final look for the show - delivered at 45 days 
- Animated Pilot (Runtime 3.5 mins) with the above mentioned script - delivered at 90 days

*transferred to Atrium Multi-sig upon execution*

---

Note: *Subsequent funding pathway for future Acts as detailed below with the rough timeline*. As we go further along the production (optional and will come in different proposals), the timeline gets more efficient and shrinks.



### Recap: what is Atrium?
Atrium.art is a crypto-native network of independent artists and creators. Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting, Animation, Concept Art, Voice Actors, and Music production. Together, creatives on Atrium bring experience from Pixar, Marvel, Luma Pictures, Sony, Netflix and many more.
You can see the work of Artists on Atrium [here](https://atrium.art/)
Simply put, Atrium is a way to easily piece together veteran talent to produce cinematic content.

In addition we are assembling a veteran team of creatives (10-14) associating with an external studio partner who will help set up a dedicated production pipeline to handle the needed throughput of the content. This alongside Atrium core will be entirely remote first so it will be the first non-trivial budget content workflow at this scale being funded by nouns.

### Scope of this proposal (Detailed view)
*An elaborate pre-production stage is crucial in order to explore the style and feel of a large production before locking / committing to it for the entire duration. These early steps of engagement and experimentation allow us to save time and money by avoiding costly redesigns later.* 

During Prop 195, While we created a unique and upbeat version of Nountown with character design that were standard, exploring uniqueness with heads and attire; We realised that there was scope to also explore pathways to develop a style framework that introduces : 
- More personality via body types
- Introduce unique worlds beyond nountown

#### Pre-production
##### Animation Tests done in public
This early stage style exploration allows us to converge on something that will feel coherent and appropriate for the larger production. 

An example of this pre-production work is a screen test done by Sony Animation for a feature length Popeye film: https://youtu.be/M1lzJuwJD9k?t=122
Whilst this screen test is much more elaborate and polished than we intend, Sony would have done many smaller ones leading up to this very polished result which they were proud to make public.

By doing an animation screen test we can experiment with different looks in order to find the right one. This can also serve as future reference for other Nouns animated content, as different possible “looks”.

Unlike Sony Animation, we have the advantage of building in the public eye, giving a rare glimpse into the animation process as well as giving the community a chance to share their sentiment prior to committing to a style..

##### Looks Tests done in public
The designs, the texturing and lighting of the world. Does the world feel more clean or is it more grungy like stop motion, E.G. Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio. There are many possibilities to explore. Here are just a few examples.

![](https://i.imgur.com/fXr0zYd.jpg)

#### Deliverable #1 : (45 days mark)
Screen tests in different looks + a teaser trailer for the Pilot Episode to come at 90 days mark. 

#### Story
The future of this cinematic story creation begins with a pilot screenplay, but will expand throughout subsequent acts in a way that allows for adults, teens, and kids to find something relatable within the world that is created. 
The foundations of existing Nounish stories (prop 70, prop 116) will serve as a guide for cultural relevance and overall thematic inspiration for the story but will be unique in its own right. Unlike standard film productions, our build in public stance detailed below will invite the community to experience the magic of production first hand.

#### Building in Public
- We will be setting up a dedicated corner on the Atrium Server and sharing progress on socials for people to follow-along with the creative process. We plan to release regular media updates and share sneak peeks.

- Anyone inside and outside the Nouns community is welcome to join. Most channels will be open to Public while some production related channels will be private to have agility on creative decisions. 

- We will host multiple open town halls with Creatives & the community members to hear ideas and keep the community updated on the process and progress.

- *Casting Calls Galore:* As the Story is being written, we will be introducing an interactive exercise to do casting calls from the nounish community, where we make the picks on the main and auxiliary characters from the submitted / interested community members from nouns DAO and sub DAOs.

- Behind the scenes videos and animation technicals to be produced alongside the content and be distributed after the premiere happens in between the premiere.

#### Deliverable #2 : (90 days mark)
Pilot Episodic premiering on all socials and a Drop Proposal.

#### Ask Summary Recap

### Future Funding Roadmap & Breakdown

*Note: This is optional and only shared as a future roadmap. This is NOT part of this specific proposal scope and will be subjected to their own evaluation parameters.*

It’s a first of its kind, large production endeavour which attempts to break-free from legacy content production models and Nouns DAO is at the precipice of being the only few who can enable this. When you look at traditional animated film funding today, they can range from micro budgets (Less than 1M USDC) to Jumbo budgets (200M+), and the bulk is paid for [star actors](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/artist-rights/steve-carell-minions-12-5-million-dollars-219015.html), studio supervisors, and executives. Tangled (with a whopping 260M production cost) was one of the costliest animated features made.

As we are aware, many times it is normal for incredible artists to drown out and be siloed in suboptimal work culture and long hours in the animation industry, alongside their creative input. Offering budgets that can be competitive while retaining a much higher degree of creative autonomy (in absence of network executives) , we can give them the financial security to leave a traditional studio structure and be part of a long-term vision which seeks to upend the narrative. 

All the team members defined in this proposal already have shown full commitment to come onboard if this series of proposals kicks off and embark on creating one of the highest quality production value the crypto space has seen till date. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/5R6YDTS.png)

This continues till Act 22 and 77 mins total including the pilot (3.5 mins). It runs for 550+ days if funded all the way.


### Past Funding from the DAO
3dprintguy at Atrium was funded for 20 ETH via [Prop 195](https://nouns.wtf/vote/237) and created a standalone animated short film. The same short film is to be released via a Drop proposal ([Prop 237](https://nouns.wtf/vote/237)). All significant characters that are part of the short film were released as collectible NFTs and [usable rigged 3d files](https://twitter.com/passingbags/status/1626410532507906053) were made available for free for anyone to use.


### Drop Content Proposals as we go
Dropping Content selectively through the DAO and coordinating premiere events coinciding with the Nouns mint will be a key event over the course of all of the proposals. 

All proceeds from the Drop Proposals will be split (60 [DAO] : 40 [Creators]) with the DAO.


### Our North Star
The journey does not end at the final second of content upon release. Nouns ecosystem members will be invited to submit story arcs for the future and ideas for the next runs once the core foundation and engine have been established.

We aim to self distribute the media (via socials & other partners) and our own channels to the widest audience possible and aggregate as much meaningful data as possible for an eventual streaming distribution deal.

246,Nouns Proposal Tracker,"# Nouns Proposal Tracker

## Intro

In order to operate successfully we need to be able to easily track the status of the proposals Nouns has funded and have a central place to view the end results of completed proposals. 

Currently it is difficult to determine the status of funded proposals. There are 3 statuses a funded proposal might have: completed, in progress, or rugged. As a DAO we should have a clear understanding of the status of all proposals, information related to the progress, and proof of completion which also acts as an easy way for the community to see the end result of a proposal.

## Solution

The solution for this is the Nouns Proposal Tracker which acts like a wiki for funded proposals.

This platform tracks funded proposals in real time and allows Noun holders, delegates, and proposal owners to add information about a funded proposal such as the status, progress logs, proof of completion, and comments. 

Proposals can be sorted by their status to easily give an overview of how many and what types of proposals were completed, or are in progress and how many proposers rugged the DAO.

By getting a glimpse of potential rugs we can also try to follow-up with the owners of rugged proposals to see if there is a chance to have the work completed. If there is not it's important that these people are held accountable in some way.

## Nouner and Delegate Permissions

Nouners and their delegates will be able to modify the status of proposals, add comments/questions, and add proof of completion. Any nouner or delegate can modify the status at any time. 

## Proposal Owner Permissions

Wallets that submitted proposals have the same permissions as nouners and delegates. They can also add additional wallets which can post on a specific proposal. In addition to the Nouner/delegate permissions proposal owners and their admin wallets can add progress logs. These logs can detail the progress of a given proposal.

## Open-sourced

All code will be open-sourced for others to fork, build upon, or improve. Repo will have README file the includes instructions on how to run the project locally and contribute to the code base. 

## Adding to Nouns Frontend

I can submit a pull request into the Nouns front end repo to add a link to this platform on the DAO page so it can be easily found. We can highlight its uses for those submitting proposals. 

## Team 

Deployer

Owner of Noun 375 and 609. I am a serial builder and have been building in the NFT space since 2017. I authored ERC2309 which is an ethereum standard allowing for the efficient tracking of a large amount of NFTs across platforms. I built an early NFT platform, called Cargo, which included multi chain minting tools, asset management, a robust JS library, and marketplace that securely processed 10s of millions of dollars worth of transactions.

As of late I am building the Heroes ecosystem. Heroes started as a CC0 NFT project which stored character stats and traits on chain for people to build upon. The core team is now building a robust web3 powered, free to play game in the spirit of open world building, CC0, and collaboration.

Related to Nouns I did the frontend and backend development of the Noun O'clock App as part of the Nouns Client prop house.

# Rage Quit

**Rage Quit Contract**: `0x95852813766e4A3112891FE6a47100023D61e5a4`

### Summary

RQ has been a topic discussed many times but hasn't been actually implemented. With a growing number of disgruntled members of this DAO, rage quit should have been an option a long time ago. Thank you to all members who have delegated their votes to me.

The primary argument that prevented RQ was that RQ somehow makes Nouns a security and holds the DAO liable for breaking SEC laws. This is quite flawed as the DAO already operates in grey waters in relation to SEC regulations. 

- The DAO has already acted as seed investors in proposals and mimics an investment syndicate.
- Nouns are essentially class A shares for an entity with a large treasury.
- A large portion of the treasury is in stETH which is an active area of discussion of whether it is a security or not.

If someone wanted to argue that NounsDAO breaks securities laws, they would have already done so, adding rage quit does not *suddenly* make Nouns a security.

### Rage Quit Details

This implementation is the simplest form of RQ (the contract is only ~100 lines minus comments), we didn’t want to add any smart contract complications. The flow goes as follows:

1. The treasury will fund the RQ contract in rounds. Round 1 will consist of 25% of the treasury (25% of the ETH and 25% of the stETH). If Round 1 is fully claimed (25% of Nouns have rage quit), another RQ proposal to fund Round 2 will be submitted to fund another 25% (and so on and so on). The reasoning for rounds is that we don’t want to handicap the DAO by taking custody of all funds while RQ is in process.

2. Round 1 will be active for 2 weeks, during that time, holders that wish to ragequit will transfer their Nouns to the RQ contract and receive their book value of the treasury. The reason we lock Nouns into the contract versus burn Nouns is because only the DAO has the permissions to burn Nouns, thus, the DAO can retrieve all Nouns from the contract at any point.

3. In the case there are funds left in the RQ contract after the deadline (no more people want to rage quit), the DAO can take back all remaining funds.

4. Only Nouns up to `Noun #634` (the last noun before this proposal) **will be eligible for RQ**. This is to prevent new bidders from attempting to arbitrage new Nouns that get auctioned until the prop passes/fails. We are aware that there are Nouns on secondary (currently 12) that may be arbed against the treasury but the way we look at it, these Nouns will be used to get RFV from the treasury regardless. The Nouns selling on secondary below RFV will either be delisted and claimed for RFV or someone will buy the Noun and *potentially* claim for RFV. Thus, the treasury doesn’t gain more rage quitters from the Nouns on secondary (at the very best people that buy don't rage quit).

**The current book value for each Nouns is calculated as follows:**

ETH book value for 1 Noun is `19 ETH`. This is the treasuries ETH balance **rounded down** with a 5% rage quit fee, the total is also rounded down - `floor(13144 eth / 634 * 0.95)`.

StETH book value for 1 Noun is `22 ETH`. This is the treasuries StETH balance **rounded down** with a 5% rage quit fee, the total is also rounded down - `floor(14764 eth / 634 * 0.95)`.

### Review of the contract:

Most of the variables are immutable constants as to prevent any malicious prop that may siphon more funds out of the treasury. **Please ensure these values are correct**

    // floor(13144 / 634 * 0.95)
    uint256 public constant ETH_BOOK_VALUE = 19 ether;

    // this is the steth treasury balance (rounded down) divided by 634 with a 5% tax

```

`function extendDeadline(uint256 _claimDeadline) external`: **This function can only be called via prop by the DAO**. This increases the claim deadline and should be called in the same prop that funds the RQ contract. This effectively sets new ‘rounds’ if previous rounds have been fully claimed.

`function withdrawFunds() external`: **This function can only be called via prop by the DAO**. This allows the DAO to claim any left over funds from the RQ contract (in the case that there are no more rage quitters and there are funds left in the contract).

`function withdrawNouns(uint256[] memory nounIDs) external`: **This function can only be called via prop by the DAO**. This allows the DAO to claim all Nouns that are locked in the contract.

`function rageQuitSingleNoun(uint256 nounID) external`: This function locks a single Noun into the contract and returns the Nouns book value to the sender. 

`function rageQuitNouns(uint256[] memory nounIDs) external`: This function locks multiple Nouns and returns book value to sender in a single txn.

The flow will be done via etherscan. It's a similar flow to Opensea where you first `setApprovalForAll()` for the RQ contract and then call `rageQuitSingleNoun()` with your Noun ID. If there is a desire for a frontend, we can whip something up quickly.

### Funding

We will fund the RQ contract with `3268 ETH` and `3674 StETH` which will allow up to 172 Nouns to rage quit (~25%).

25% of ETH calculation: `floor(13144 * 0.25 / 19) * 19`
25% of StETH calculation: `floor(14767 * 0.25 / 22) * 22`

249,Nouns block graffiti x ETH solo staking,"# Nouns block graffiti x ETH solo staking

## TL;DR

We propose to create a 10 ETH monthly prize pool for the next three months where any solo staker that puts “⌐◨-◨” into their validator’s [graffiti flag](https://nimbus.guide/graffiti.html) can be permissionlessly eligible to win 1 ETH.

![](https://i.imgur.com/MImNUFD.jpg)

(paintbrush noun snacking after a hard day of nouns graffiti; CC0 art by [brandonmighty](https://foundation.app/@brandonmighty/nounsatwork/6))

---

## Why should Nouns incentivize solo staking?

We see solo staking as something incredibly nounish. It embodies a desire to contribute to the production and maintenance of a public good (in this case Ethereum’s decentralization) with the optimistic view that individuals’ independent judgment and actions [can make a difference](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1595793106926014466).

However, solo staking, as the name suggests, can be quite lonely. So we wanted to help make it more fun by introducing a distinctly nounish playful & absurdist element: a nouns block graffiti prize pool.

## How can you participate?

If you already have a staking setup, all you need to do is add “⌐◨-◨” to the graffiti flag of your consensus client.

If you aren’t yet a staker, but always wanted to and this prop is motivating you to stake some of your ETH, then that’s amazing and we’ll be rooting for you! 

The easiest way to solo stake from home (in our opinion) is [buying an Intel NUC](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1546302759439421440) (along with 2TB SSD and 32GB RAM chips) and setting up Dappnode, an open source node operator that helps you install and run Ethereum clients of your choice. You can also buy a ready-to-use staking node from [Dappnode’s store](https://dappnode.com/en-us/collections/frontpage) which makes it is even easier.

## How will the prizes be paid out?

The prize ETH will initially be held in a multisig. At the end of each month, starting April, we will initiate a 10 ETH transaction to a smart contract (to be developed) that randomly selects 10 winners amongst a list of candidate validator addresses.

We’ll use the following options as the validator's address (in this order): A) validator’s ENS (if included in the block graffiti), B) withdrawal address (if set by the validator), and C) the “from” address of the staking deposit transaction. 

The spirit of this proposal is to celebrate and incentivize solo stakers. If we find that a large staking pool is attempting to ruin the fun, we’ll disclose those validators publicly on Twitter and not include them as potential prize candidates.

## How can you follow along?

We’ll create a site that showcases the ⌐◨-◨ graffiti blocks etched into the Ethereum blockchain. We might also create a Twitter bot that tweets out whenever a new block with noggles is discovered.

# Proposal: Noun Nyms

__special thanks to [Noun 40](https://twitter.com/noun40__) for delegating us a noun to make this proposal__

## Background

Personae Labs is exploring the future of pseudonymity in Ethereum.

We launched heyanoun.xyz (prop 150) as an early experiment in allowing private truths to surface. 

While we fundamentally believe that there's value in allowing controversial opinions to surface, we think heyanoun is far from healthy pseudonymity's final form:
1. it's impossible to engage with a heyanoun opinion pseudonymously
2. it's hard to filter spam/toxicity from actually useful discourse
3. users have no way to accrue 'reputation' to their pseudonymous selves

With this in mind, we're entering our next phase of iteration and we want to launch zk-powered pseudonyms and discussions for nouners. 

This will be the first implementation of our [simple persistent pseudonym](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-simple-persistent-pseudonym-scheme/14930) scheme. 

These both represent relatively ideas in zk-app development and represent a pretty large leap forward from existing capabilities. When we sat down to think about which internet community to pilot them for, the answer was obvious: Nouns.

We hope that through this work, we'll continue iterating on healthy discussions in the future internet together.

We'll deliver a hacker news/reddit-style website with two primary features for nouners (verified by ZKP as with heyanoun v1):
1. persistent pseudonyms
2. threaded pseudonymous discussions

### threaded discussions

Heyanoun v1 messages can't be replied to or held accountable. While we often see situations in which users broadcast a message effectively replying to a previously posted message, threading isn't explicit.

In v2, we plan to make it possible to reply to an arbitrary previous message, thus enabling arbitrary discussion trees to form. 

We believe that this is crucial for re-engagement.

We'll build on the second idea briefly mentioned [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-simple-persistent-pseudonym-scheme/14930#extensions-10) to do so. 

As mentioned earlier, we're designing a hacker news/reddit-style interface for creating new discussion points and commenting on old ones.

### persistent pseudonyms

Heyanoun v1 had no sense of persistence in user identity. Users post messages into the ether.

We believe that with some notion of persistent pseudonyms, we can enable more interesting pseudonymous conversations between nouners. Persistent pseudonyms also allow for simple mechanisms of reputation and content filtering.

It becomes possible, for example, to filter discussion to just those discussions involving a well-known pseudonym.

Additionally, nouners will be able to bring their pseudonyms anywhere on the internet; only a specific nouner can generate the proof corresponding to a specific pseudonym. 

Although we won't be designing for this initially, this portability means that these pseudonyms can be re-used in other internet venues, similar to an ENS name. 

### (rough) user flow

We imagine the following user flow (designs pending):
- user generates proof of nouner-ship
- user picks pseudonym to attach to message
    - any pseudonym they've used before or a new one
- user picks message in-thread to reply to

In this way, nouners add pseudonymous messages with pseudonyms attached to one big nounish, pseudonymous discussion tree.

## Secondary deliverables

### downstream consumption by API

As mentioned above, the resulting 'data artifact' produced is a tree of proofs, pseudonyms, and messages. 

While today, the main consumption methods for heyanoun messages are twitter/discord bots, we want to open the API such that any nounish downstream site can pull relevant heyanoun messages into their site. 

### integration with spartan-ecdsa and further proving improvements

In parallel with our work on heyanoun, we've been working at [improving our technical capabilities](https://twitter.com/personae_labs/status/1621575568109223936?s=20).

With heyanoun v2, we'll upgrade our proving stack to the latest and greatest, which will result in considerably faster (<10s in most cases) proving times.

## Timeline and ask

We come to the DAO presenting an outcome we believe we can drive towards: zk-pseudonyms available to every nouner and a platform for those pseudonyms to have threaded conversation.

**Our ask to the DAO is $160k in helping us reach this outcome.**

As it's quite a hefty amount of new technology, we expect this to take ~6months for a team of 3-4 devs.

Restated from above, the deliverables:
- a new hacker news/reddit-style website, built around
  - pseudonym selection
  - zk-gated discussion threading
- APIs for downstream consumption of conversation
- integration with the best of our proving stack

As always, our code will be open sourced and made available for extension and re-use.

251,Showcase Nouns 3D-Printed Fashion Collection at NFT.NYC,"# Showcase Nouns 3D-Printed Fashion Collection at NFT.NYC

![](https://i.imgur.com/onFwPa6.jpg)

After a very successful debut at NFT Paris, I want to expose more people to my  Nouns-inspired 3D printed fashion collection of 5 looks at NFT.NYC on April 12-14.

Since the collection currently has momentum and is ""hot"", I strongly believe the DAO should double down on showcasing it at relevant events and getting more IRL eyeballs on it.

**Summary:**
* **Exhibition Space:** the Fashion area of the event in NYC’s Javits Center
* **Expected Attendance:** 8,000 -10,000
* **Total Costs:** $51,720 
	* **Exhibition Space Rental:** $10,000 (goes to nft.nyc)
	* **Exhibition Space A/V, Furniture & Logistics:**  $22,220
	* **Video Animation**: $1,500
	* **Travel:** $6,000 (2 People)
	* **My Comp:** $12,000

**Why NFT.NYC?**
* NFT.NYC is one of the world’s most prominent NFT events. Last year's Nouns presence in the city during the events was very valuable.
* The collection is striking and attracts a lot of attention. It’s a fantastic way to present the Nouns and expose more people to the brand.
* During my conversations at NFT Paris, I realized how many people have never heard of Nouns. Using the collection & its funding story as a Nouns marketing tool is very powerful.

**Details of what we will get at NFT.NYC**

* 100 Square Foot Exhibition Booth at the fashion corner, April 12-14
* Event Branding - NFT Swag Bag inclusion, Logo on AV materials
* Ticket Package - 2 GA Tickets, 2 Expo Staff Passes
* Working with Reaction AV LED Wall - 11"" X 8""
* Working with T3 to bring 5 Mannequin and pedestal 
* AR instagram filter for each look

**Expected Outcome**

* Exposing Nouns to 8,000-10,000 NFT-curious American audience (most of the NFT Paris audience was European)
* Creating additional opportunities thanks to the serendepity of a massive event
    * e.g. In Paris, I met the host of Miami NFT Week who will wear one of the looks on stage while hosting the event
* We may get more press thanks to the collection and my physical presence at NFT.NYC.


**Recap of NFT Paris:**
* 18,000 people attended, and saw the collection and its interactive exhibition area which was right smack in the center of the event
* The exhibition featured five looks dressed on mannequins.
* The beautiful [nounsvision](https://nounsvision.com/) glasses complemented the garments, and many people were happy to try them on IRL and take pictures with them
* There were [AR instagram filters](https://imgur.com/a/RKIZlBR) for each garment, which got 5.6K exposures on Instagram
* [Four holograms](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpUUpw4MJsy/) showcased the collection’s virtual runway show 
* A huge screen looped a [video of the collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHauDW5BQQY) made by the nounish ⌐◨-◨  team. 
* I gave a 20 minute talk about Nouns DAO and the making of the collection.

252,Nouns Fine Jewellery by: State Property – supported by HeyMint,"# Nouns Fine Jewellery by: State Property – supported by HeyMint

**tl;dr**: Asking for USDC188,150 to bridge Nouns into the luxury fine jewellery scene with State Property; to create contemporary 1/1 Nouns-themed pieces sold via auction, with 100% proceeds going back to the Nouns treasury.

![](https://i.imgur.com/0sOrNun.png)
**Description:**
State Property and Nouns presents **NFJ, an exclusive collection of Nounish fine jewellery**.

Drawing inspiration from the visual aesthetics of Nouns, the jewellery designs embody elements of meme culture and Nounish culture. Staying true to the Nouns style, the drop will be released via a daily auction, with 100% proceeds from the auctions going back to the NounsDAO treasury.
![](https://i.imgur.com/QnTnl7I.png)
NFJ lies at the intersection of Nouns, non-fungible tokens (NFT), and fine jewellery. Using NFT to deliver this physical collection, it represents our shared enthusiasm towards this phenomenon where culture and technology converge.

The NFJ project is a strategic collaboration between three brands:
1. **Nouns**, with its extensive network and NFT presence
2. **State Property**, a fine jewellery label known for their contemporary designs, whose distribution network spreads globally, and the choice of many reknown celebrities
4. **HeyMint**, smart contract and technical experts who have centered their mission around making Web3 accessible to everyone

Through this collaboration, we hope to achieve the following:
- Proliferate the brands of all three partners
- Introduce Nouns and fine jewellery to NFT collectors; introduce blockchain technology and NFTs to traditional fine jewellery audience
- Develop an exclusive line of fine jewellery that is worth collecting, and for full auction proceeds to go back to the Nouns treasury
- Create sustainable utility, where Nouns holders can tap onto HeyMint's Smart Contract Launchpad to launch their own NFT collections

# Fine Jewellery, NFT, and Nouns
Fine jewellery is a specific class of jewellery that uses precious metals and gemstones, and is known for their exquisite craftsmanship. Because of their exceptional quality and high value, fine jewellery pieces are often passed down as family heirloom.

The emergence of NFTs has opened up many possibilities. With Nouns, a self-governing organisation that begets organic brand building has emerged. With fine jewellery, NFT presents a means to collect and authenticate fine jewellery with ease.

NFJ celebrates Nouns by incorporating Nounish elements everywhere. Designing around Nounish elements instead of a specific Noun gives the jewellery pieces broad appeal, and when collectors discover their backstory, it becomes extra meaningful. Our goal is to start with an exclusive first collection, with potential for wider releases as awareness and demand grow.

# **The NFJ Project**

**The NFJ Project comprises of a few key deliverables:**
1. Design and crafting of the 1/1 physical jewellery pieces
2. NFJ exhibition
3. Media event and online proliferation
4. Daily timed-auctions
5. Redemption for physical jewellery with NFT
6. Post-event activations

**1: Design And Crafting**
The NFJ collection embodies the vibrancy of the Noun characters. Taking cue from iconic Noun traits, the collection is an artistic expression of meme culture and Nouns culture while retaining the quintessential luxe of fine jewellery.

All our physical jewellery will be made in 18-Karat gold and will contain gemstones ranging from white diamonds, coloured diamonds, sapphires, rubies, and tsavorites. Specific specifications as shown below: 
![](https://i.imgur.com/zqkYDBl.jpg)

There are a total of nine designs, each of which are bespoke and one-of-a-kind. This is similar to the concept of 1/1 NFTs where there is only ever one of that piece and its provenance is cemented on the blockchain.

The technical drawings above showcase State Property's creative vision and their artistry in adopting Nounish aesthetics. In giving this luxury spin to Nouns, State Property has designed for these pieces to appeal to the luxury fine jewellery audience that they are very familiar with, and are aware of clients who will be eager to get their hands on them. 

Upon passing of the proposal and successive funding, the designs will be turned into 3D, moulded, and then crafted. Thereafter, we'll do a photoshoot of the physical pieces. 

**2: Jewellery Exhibition**
The launch of NFJ kicks off with a fortnight-long exhibition for these nine jewellery pieces, hosted at State Property's Atelier. There will be daily online features during the campaign period on [NounsinSG Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg) and  State Property's [socials](https://instagram.com/thisisstateproperty), sharing the backstory and inspiration behind the collection and the designs. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/97Aw6WO.jpg)
*Outside view of State Property Atelier's main showroom – decorated with Noggles.*

![](https://i.imgur.com/eITF36S.jpg)
*Display showcase updated in Noggles and the collection theme.*

Located in the civic district of Singapore, the State Property showroom at [Armenian Street](https://www.nac.gov.sg/resources/engagements-with-the-sector/45-armenian-street) is the perfect venue for the exhibition and event. The area has been designated as an arts space and often draws in huge crowds during seasonal events. Utilising State Property's space is strategic and would also lower the ask of the proposal.

Based on our expected timeline, we plan for the exhibition to coincide with [Token2049](https://www.asia.token2049.com/) (13–14 September 2023) and [F1 Singapore](https://www.gpmotorsportstickets.com/formula-1/singapore-grand-prix-tickets/) (15–17 September 2023). While Token2049 attracts a Web3 audience, F1 draws in tourists from around the world. 

State Property's central location and proximity to these events makes it really easy for interested visitors to hop over to check out the exhibition during the week. Our goal is to maximise attendance and reach of the exhibition, which will grow the attention and demand for the auction. Thereafter, the media event will happen the week after the F1 weekend so as to deconflict from the packed schedule of international visitors.

**3: Media Event And Online Proliferation**
The key highlight of the exhibition will be the media night. This will be held on the second week of the exhibition.

> **Expected Event Dates**
Exhibition: 11 Sep, Monday – 24 Sep, Sunday
Media Night: 22 Sep, Friday
Daily Auctions: 25 Sep, Monday – 3 Oct, Tuesday

We'll be inviting the local media and influencers to cover the event. The NFJ collection will also be featured in [Tatler Asia](https://www.tatlerasia.com/) magazine *(Luxury media brand in Asia with over 3M monthly online visitors)*, and will be covered by jewellery reviewer, [Katerina Perez](https://katerinaperez.com/) (*Jewellery insider with over 13 years experience and over 400K Followers on Instagram*).

We will also extend invitations to various NFT communities as well as State Property's clientele. And on the event day, we will have a Nouns booth by @NounsinSG to share more about Nouns, and also a [NFT Workshop](https://www.wereearly.xyz/resources/intro-to-nft) hosted by @Han (Beetle) to introduce NFTs to the non-Web3 fine jewellery audience.
![](https://i.imgur.com/bb09JvH.png)

**4. Daily Timed-Auctions**
At the end of the exhibition and event, we will kickstart the online auction for the 1/1 Jewellery NFTs in Nouns-style i.e. one NFT per day. Each time an auction is settled, the settlement transaction will also cause the next NFT to be released and a new 24H auction to begin. **Full proceeds from the auctions will go to the Nouns treasury.**

Winners of the auction will be able to receive the corresponding 1/1 Jewellery. This is done through a redemption process on the website, and they will receive the physical jewellery at no additional cost.

**5.Redemption For Physical Jewellery With NFT**
When all the daily auctions conclude, the website will be updated with a Redemption Page. Jewellery NFT owners will be able to redeem for the physical jewellery. 

The redemption process requires NFT owners to enter their personal particulars and delivery details, and a confirmation email will be sent before the delivery is dispatched. During the process, NFT owners need to allow the website to read the wallet for the NFT and sign an on-chain transaction to update the NFT. 

Once redeemed, the NFT will be updated with a 'Redeemed' status. Buyers and owners of a 'Redeemed' NFT will not be able to redeem for the physical jewellery. Redemption of the physical jewellery is optional. 

**6.Post-Event Activations**
NFJ is more than a one-time activation. We want to ensure continuity with whatever we've been funded to build, which includes releasing a second collection and giving access to a NFT launchpad.

**I: The Noggle Collection**
You might notice that none of the designs in the first collection incorporated the Noggle. This was intentional so that the designs can have broad appeal while being Nounish. As fine jewellery is often an article that initiates conversation, we also want people to ask, ""What about the Noggles?""

![](https://i.imgur.com/RuOIK35.png)

This brings us to the second collection, which will be released as demand scales up. These will be customisable and also redeemable for their physical counterparts. 

**II: Build With HeyMint**
[HeyMint](https://heymint.xyz) has developed two tools – an allowlist manager, and a no-code NFT creator tool, HeyMint. While the basic smart contract launchpad is free to use, premium features like Staking, Burning, Soulbinding, Refunds, and Snapshots, are token-gated to partnered communities. With the NFJ collaboration, HeyMint will grant Nouns holders premium access, which means that builders within the Nouns ecosystem will get permanent access to these creator tools.

# **Who We Are**
[**State Property**](https://thisisstateproperty.com)
Established since 2015, State Property is a fine jewellery label whose minimalistic and modern designs have been worn by Michelle Obama, Nicole Kidman, Taylor Swift, and many other celebrities. Their jewellery have also been featured in magazines including Vogue, Tatler, Cosmopolitan, and WWD. Based in Singapore, their distribution network stretches across the Middle East, EU, UK, and US (including [Net-A-Porter](https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-us/shop/designer/state-property)).
![](https://i.imgur.com/DROOkEg.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/KqyfR5Z.jpg)

State Property's collections are often inspired by nature, architecture, and even the stars, and they have a knack to imbue storytelling into their designs. For example, they have a collection (*[Voyager](https://thisisstateproperty.com/collections/the-voyager)*) with pieces named after famous adventurers, while another collection (*[Unfold](https://thisisstateproperty.com/collections/unfold)*) reimagines the classic pearl in contemporary settings. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/jkxtzOX.png)

State Property's clientele are typically working professionals or high net worth individuals who can afford to spend on fine jewellery. They are attracted to State Property's unique and contemporary designs that can be worn casually or for more formal occasions.
![](https://i.imgur.com/SMvpaAk.jpg)
Edgy designs, celebrity fanfare, and established distribution aside, State Property is uniquely positioned to step into the NFT scene. With their design-centric background and artistic interest, founders Ruiyin and Afzal recognises the advent of NFT as another platform for creative expression, just like jewellery. Their readiness to experiment and embrace new innovations also positions them to onboard the largely traditional industry and non-Web3 collectors into the space. 

**[HeyMint](https://heymint.xyz)**
A team of creatives and developers who aims to build the best free tools available so as to help make Web3 mainstream. HeyMint are experienced technical builders and has helped major brands in the NFT space with their drops, including Zen Academy, World Of Women Galaxy, Kingship, and The Littles. Founders Mai Akiyoshi and Ben Yu are software engineers at heart and have grown their passion into a technical team who build tools for the Web3 economy.

![](https://i.imgur.com/PapVaWA.png)

With NFJ, HeyMint are the right fit as technical partners as they envision a similar future shaped by Web3 builders. NFJ is just the start that adds a single Auction function onto their Launchpad. Opening up their Launchpad to the many builders within the Nouns ecosystem also puts them in the best position to tap onto these creative minds, while they focus on being the technical experts. The potential projects that will come out of this collaboration is endless and will certainly contribute to the exponential growth and adoption of Web3 and NFTs.

**Han [(Beetle)](https://twitter.com/beetleswt)**
The one who ties it all together. Han is an active community lead in CloneX Singapore; he regularly coordinates local meet-ups and collaborates with other global CloneX community leads to spearhead initiatives for the community.
![](https://i.imgur.com/SalAzSa.jpg)
Han believes that the future of brand building is NFTs and brands will build in a ground-up manner alongside their communities. He runs regular NFT workshops for small groups and for corporates to introduce them to the concept of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. The workshops include a hands-on NFT minting session that uses Nouns Playground to create the visuals and leads to a discussion on DAOs. *See [presentation materials](https://www.wereearly.xyz/resources/intro-to-nft).* 

Over the past three years, Han has worked closely with State Property with their digital marketing efforts. He was also one of the early evangelists with the HeyMint team. In bringing together all the contributing partners, Han will also be the main project lead coordinating on the physical jewellery and technical end, while working alongside Karl to engage with the NFT communities.

**[Karl](https://twitter.com/WideEyeKarl) (@Nounsinsg)**
Karl is a Nouns evangelist who spearheaded [@Nounsinsg](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg), a proliferation pod focused on raising Nouns Presence in Singapore. His fascination with the organic growth of Nouns has led him to onboard many traditional brands, builders, and NFT collectors into Nouns.

It was through the [Nounish Beach Clean Up](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-nounish-beach-clean-up/1653/15?u=wideeyekarl) when Karl and Han met, which led to the current NFJ proposal, where high-level creatives like State Property are onboarded. His enthusiasm is highly infectious and his Nounish contribution inspired many other builders in the NFT space.

![](https://i.imgur.com/hP0qGd0.png)

Karl's main role in this project will be as a strategic advisor and gatekeeper to ensure the project stays aligned with the Nouns ethos. He'll also be working alongside Han to engage other NFT communities, and will be the Nouns ambassador running the Nouns booth during the exhibition and media event.

TLDR
=====

We are proposing $202k funding for the first permanent Nouns IRL food service store. The plan is to rebrand a venue currently owned by 87Bones ([Noun 552](https://nouns.wtf/noun/552)) in Melbourne, Australia, turning it ‘Nounish’. With this we will create an open franchisable package with the intention of scale. The team is already highly respected in the industry with experience across the breadth of the field. As the venue is already a profitable business, we believe this would be a low-risk opportunity for Nouns to enter the IRL space. After initial funding this site will be totally self-sustainable.

The shop redesign will be largely cosmetic.  A benefit of recreating an already established venue is that most of the infrastructure and industrial equipment has already been purchased.

Instead, the funding will be spent on ‘Nounifying’ the deli and adding custom fixtures to proliferate the brand. The new design will feature screens displaying the nouns daily auctions amongst other Nounish content. We will install large display shelves allowing the sale of a custom merch and a consumable range. Alongside the Nouns deli branded merch and consumable, this space could be an additional platform for previous and future successful Nouns proposals to sell their products on consignment.

Our goal is to build the Nouns Deli brand into a scalable business, opening up opportunities to expand around the world. Sticking to the Nouns CC0 philosophy, our vision is to build a fee-less franchise model; we intend to make everything open source, available to all. As this is rare in the hospitality industry, we expect it to gain a lot of attention, and with it the potential for even more brand proliferation. [Goldy](https://twitter.com/Goldypix) (Nounish, Goat Club) & Jarmen ([Noun 332](https://nouns.wtf/noun/332)) will be jumping on the team in Noun advisory roles to focus on public relations/education & content.

The Deli / The Team **⌐◧-◧**
----------------------------

Stan’s Deli is a local community hotspot, positioned off one of Melbourne’s most popular boutique shopping strips comprising over 400 retail shops. The area is central to some of Melbourne’s most affluent suburbs. Stan’s is known for its coffee and sandwiches, consistently being voted in the top 5 sandwich venues in Melbourne. The deli has been operating as a profitable business for 3 years with a further 3x3x3 left on the lease. The owners are three experts in the hospitality and retail industry, who between them operate 10 retail spaces, 3 beverage brands and over 40 years combined experience in the industry.

This teams owns some of Melbourne’s most iconic venues and have a strong track record: Chef hats (Australia’s Michelin Star), ongoing listings in critics top foodie destinations, best fitout awards and a non-alcoholic beverage brand selling over 1.2 million serves across 8 countries and a VC funding deal of AUD $13m.  
The team’s expertise spreads across all aspects of the business, from food and beverage development, day to day business logistics to brand creation and marketing. Between them, they know the ins and outs of creating a successful business.

[See full video here](http://stansdeli.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-2.mp4)

**Flipping it Nounish ⌐◧-◧**
----------------------------

To make the venue truly Nounish, Stan’s Deli will need a full cosmetic facelift. The essential commercial equipment will remain, but significant changes to the design of the deli are needed to highlight the Noun brand. Our goal is to create a timeless sandwich shop model, incorporating the Nounish pixel art-focused design that can easily be replicated in different locations worldwide. Along with this timeless and replicable design, we want to incorporate custom neon Noggles and exterior murals designed by local artists to make each franchise unique to its location.

Driving home the Nouns brand, we want to add a modern twist, installing screens to display the Nouns daily auctions & other Nounish content on rotation. While customers grab a bite, they can engage and learn more about the DAO.

![](https://i.postimg.cc/6QwWSfFk/stansdeliinside-1.jpgg)

**CC0 ⌐◧-◧**
------------

With a CC0 culture, the new Nouns Deli will change the narrative in the hospitality industry. Currently, it all happens behind closed doors; the secret herbs and spices, special burger sauces. Heck, coke has its recipe in a bank vault that only two people can access at a time. We want to spread the Nouns CC0 philosophy and make everything open source through our CC0 library; recipes, package designs and branding assets will all be made available on our website. The wave of interest and attention the CC0 model will create in this industry will give us the perfect platform to share these core Nouns values.

**The Model ⌐◧-◧**
------------------

The team is proposing a franchisable model for scaling when ready. Adhering to the Nouns philosophy, there will be no fee associated with this franchise model. To ensure the brand is held to a high standard, those wishing to be officially affiliated with Nouns Deli will have to undertake a compulsory screening process. Once the original Nouns Deli is established, our team will provide consulting and mentoring services to approved franchisees. The goal is for scalability, the ability to replicate across the world.

![](https://i.postimg.cc/Xv8j0ybp/a28d36944e9a917b2c2d81a5e45d81b0.jpg)

**The App ⌐◧-◧ -**
------------------

![](https://i.postimg.cc/hjZKXWhn/NOUN-LOYALTY-APP.jpg)

A custom app will be developed as an easily accessible platform for the Noun’s Deli community and will extend to include any additional franchises. The app will reward regular customers through a loyalty program model, allowing them to earn points towards benefits or discounts with each purchase; a modern day coffee loyalty card. Customers will stay engaged through the use of push notifications, delivering exclusive offers such as happy hours discounts and CTA rewards. These push notifications can also be an opportunity to circulate engaging creative content and Nounish news. The CC0 library will also be made available on the app, alongside cooking videos and other educational tools. Our mobile app will encourage return clientele, creating an experience that extends the reach beyond the physical brick and mortar offerings, drawing them back to further engage with Nouns.

**Proliferation/touch points ⌐◧-◧**
-----------------------------------

The potential for proliferation with a franchise model grows with every expansion. The team has a presence in the local hospitality industry and strong existing relationships with three core media agencies in Melbourne—Broadsheet, UrbanList, and Concrete Playground—which have a combined reach of 6.4 million. The team will use these connections to gain feature articles and free marketing. Our paid marketing strategies will focus on two areas: online viability using large platforms such as Twitter to reach current untapped audiences, and physical presence focusing on capturing the already large NFT culture within Melbourne. This would include poster runs, pop-up NFT events, and catering to NFT/Web3 conferences. To ensure the Nounish culture of giving is also proliferated, we hope to give out free Nouns ‘Deli Burgers’ wrapped in noggles paper to underprivileged communities. We want to highlight the incredible impact this DAO has had and will continue to have, essentially sharing the story.

Our vision for the first permanent Nouns IRL store is bigger than just a sandwich shop with Noggles painted on; we want to create an approachable educational tool for the DAO. QR codes on coffee cups, enabling us to direct daily traffic selected content, such as the ‘This is Nouns’ video highlighting content from other successful props. Currently averaging around 100,000 coffee sales each year, this is just one easily executed proliferation tool.

As we are entering uncharted territory for the DAO we believe transparency with data collection from these marketing tools and activations is useful information for the community and future proposers. All analytics gathered will be made available on our website.

![](https://i.postimg.cc/C15gTP7Q/ezgif-5-e168849c16.gif)

The Sauce ⌐◧-◧
==============

An avenue we believe has huge potential is a “Nouns Deli Sauce” range. We want to create a packaged consumable range that will be featured throughout our in-store menu. Launching the range will be the “Nouns Hot Sauce”. Our dear friend, Mathew Garthweight, owner of [Mats Hot Shop](https://matshotshop.com/en-us)—Australia’s leading boutique hot sauce distributor—will collaborate with Nouns Deli to produce our very own “Nouns Hot Sauce”. The products will be available to ship worldwide, allowing consumers to recreate Nouns Deli sandwiches at home. Matt has previously created his own range of hot sauces with huge success, winning multiple international competitions. Upon release, one hot sauce will be made claimable for each Noun holder. Other sauces we intend to roll out into the range are “Nouns Burger Sauce” and “Nouns Dipping Ranch”, but the possibilities are endless and can be rolled out according to consumer demand.

Building out our new menu, we plan to feature a ‘Deli Burger’ as a nod to Noun 552 owned by 87Bones. This burger will be served in branded sleeves, and is sure to be one of the most recognizable items on the menu. Furthermore, the Deli Burger will be the item served at all of our pop-up events. Additionally, we will invite guest chefs to collaborate and create menu items inspired by other Nouns.

![](https://i.postimg.cc/hhWWmSBk/ezgif-3-71fedd840b.gif)

**Retail/Merch ⌐◧-◧**
---------------------

Stan’s Deli has been highly successful with its merchandise in the past, so we intend to release some branded Nouns Deli merchandise. The first drop will feature Nouns Deli t-shirts, hoodies, coffee mugs, a tote bag, and our consumable range.

Furthermore, we would like to use our space to create a platform for previous and future successful Nouns proposals to sell their products on consignment, thus providing another platform for the success of Nouns products.

**ROI ⌐◧-◧**
------------

This is not merely a “flash-in-the-pan” proposition; instead, the intention is to promote long-term proliferation of Nouns. The store will serve as a “permanent” educational billboard for the DAO, enabling it to capture public attention and provide information and content through multiple touchpoints. This will create a scalable IP for public benefit. Moreover, the store will be an opportunity to grow the community, share resources and knowledge regarding the DAO. Having already established itself as a popular foodie destination, and with a team committed to providing great hospitality supplemented with education, Nouns Deli is set to be a success.

**The Risk ⌐◧-◧**
-----------------

Why would we close a profitable business? ""As a recently minted Noun holder, I’m committed to the Nouns brand and believe it can become widely recognised in the near future. The Nouns model aligns with my morals and values and I want to use my resources and skill set to proliferate this incredible brand.” - 87Bones.

**Additional Factors ⌐◧-◧**
---------------------------

The rebranding fit-out will cause some time of closure and loss of revenue, we predict around 2 months until Nouns Deli can open its doors to the public. Having built a strong team over the past three years, we would like to hold on to the core members through this time. We intend to utilise this time to educate our team on all things Nouns, by reopening, our team will be able to guide our guests through the nouns ecosystem with ease.

Other costs that will continue during the closure are rent, insurance, utilities and other creditors.

The Budget ⌐◧-◧
---------------

![](https://i.postimg.cc/9Q2z527g/NOUNS-BUDGET.jpg)

Payment Schedule ⌐◧-◧
---------------------

We are proposing a three-milestone payment schedule for funds from the multi-sig. The first payment will be used to commence the designs for the Deli, develop the website and app, and obtain the necessary permits for the site. The second payment will be made on the date of Stan’s Deli’s closure and allocated towards the shop fit-out. The third and final payment will be made on the day of Nouns Deli’s opening and designated towards the marketing and PR budget.

***************special thanks to the Lil Nouns for the help in shaping this proposal and for putting it onchain***************

**TL;DR**

A new Nouns service to place NFTs in Apple & Google Wallets, unlocking the ability for communities to send push notifications to token holders and for simple event token gating

- A new communication layer for token-based communities.
- Tooling that makes web3 more understandable to the mainstream.
- A free tool, available to every web3 community — where every new community that uses the tool proliferates the noggles and their association with building exceptional public infrastructure.

**About us**

We’re good at making stuff go mainstream & viral – like our website [Poolsuite.net](http://poolsuite.net), our music app [Poolsuite FM](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/poolsuite-fm/id1514817810), our sunscreen co [Vacation®](https://twitter.com/marty/status/1616852882480840709?s=20), and our [Palm Report](https://www.palm.report/) newsletter which is read by over 70,000 people every week. At Poolsuite, we’re a small team of passionate builders with a desire to create beautiful internet products, and we’re keen to understand the appetite within the Nouns community to collaborate. While we don’t yet have a treasury that enables us to focus our primary efforts on public goods, we can bring our deep understanding of consumer products and expertise in crafting rich brand worlds to the Nouns ecosystem. In the same way we have begun collaborating with major designer brands (alpha soon) we want to do the same within web3, and we see Nouns as one the most actively engaged and innovative communities in the space, uniquely positioned for us to work with on wonderfully designed products that push forward web3 adoption alongside the combined awareness of our brands.

**INTRODUCING NOUNS WALLET SERVICE**

---

Nouns Wallet Service would allow any user to add **any NFT** (or ERC-20) into their Apple/Android wallet — the same place they keep their loyalty cards, boarding passes, and credit cards — unlocking the ability for web3 communities to send push notifications to token holders and a wealth of powerful future use cases. This tool would be usable by any Ethereum based DAO/NFT collection. 

![Screenshot 2023-01-09 at 10.20.37 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XJ8yckxs/Screenshot-2023-01-09-at-10-20-37-PM.png)

**Why?**

- In the mainstream view, NFTs are still mostly seen as investment assets but placing NFTs side by side with loyalty cards and boarding passes tangibly demonstrates that they offer much more and can unlock a variety of experiences. To bring the next wave of mainstream users to web3, we need tools that make the web3 experience as friendly as web2.
- There's an engagement problem in web3; its incredibly hard to communicate with token holders. We've seen this first hand fighting our way to the top of the Twitter feed to notify our [Executive Members](https://members.poolsuite.net/) of new drops. A lot of communities are building their own apps to try to solve this engagement challenge but not every project needs an app.
- The shutdown of the Nouns Discord opened the door for reimagining what the communication and social layers can look like for decentralized communities. Nouns communications are currently fragmented. And while there are various [chat groups](https://nouns.center/groups), [newsletters](https://nouns.substack.com/), and Twitter accounts, there is no simple real-time communication layer that is gaining significant traction.

****************************Considerations****************************

- Nouns Wallet Service would be a free tool, available to every web3 community.
- Every new community that uses the tool would proliferate the noggles and their association with building public web3 infrastructure. Nouns Wallet Service would launch as “Nouns Wallet Service public infrastructure by Nouns DAO”, similar to [Prop House](https://prop.house/), [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build/), [Voters.wtf](https://www.voters.wtf/nouns).
- Unlike with mobile apps, push notifications are enabled by default with wallet passes, meaning no additional opt-in is required.
- Last year we built an early version of Wallet Service for our Executive Members that generated a ton of excitement within our community, and we’re confident we can develop this into a fully-packaged service that works incredibly well for both centralized and decentralized communities.
- We’ve passed Lil Nouns prop lot with 687 upvotes (9% consensus) – s/o Lil Nouns community for feedback, helping us shape up this proposal, and for putting this proposal onchain.

**Funding Request**

We’re asking for 120 ETH to design and build Nouns Wallet Service including 1 year of maintenance from our team. To bring the next wave of mainstream users to web3, we need tools that make the web3 experience as friendly as web2 – and we believe these tools should be built as public infrastructure, freely available for all DAOs. The funding would go towards:

- **Web App** – Designing & building a beautiful interactive web app where users will be able to connect wallet and select which NFTs to add to their mobile wallet (on desktop: scan QR, on mobile: download natively). We’ll design this interface alongside the Nouns community to reach an exceptional execution of the Nouns brand.
- **Token Integration** – Building upon our rudimentary alpha version to integrate with any Ethereum token based community (ERC-721, 1155, and 20)
- **Custom Push Notifications** – Creating a customizable push notification system where Nouners (and other Nounish DAO members) will be able to choose frequency (live, daily, weekly) and type of notifications from a selection of onchain events (new proposal submitted, funded, voting open, capital deployed, prop house voting open, etc.).
- **Admin Panel** – Creating an admin panel for teams to manage & send custom push notifications & update the text & links on the back of the passes.
- **Pass Designs** – Automating the design process of wallet passes based on any NFT visual assets. For Nouns and lil Nouns we’ll design custom passes which we’ll share with the community for approval. For other communities, we’ll automatically assign a color scheme based on the NFT imagery (unique for each NFT).

********************************Potential future use cases********************************

- Token gating IRL with a QR scanner: Wallet Service would allow for a very simple 1 NFT = 1 Event Ticket gating system.
- Integrating new sources of notifications for Nouns/Nounish DAOs such as Prop House events, votes from key delegates (Nouncil voted “For” Proposal 367), 3rd party sources to select from (ex. Discord), etc.
- Ability to customize pass fields to include points/token balance(s), contributor status, awards, and to allow users to add their name to the card or select their own colors.",ACTIVE,16882798,16918798,1,96,,1000000,1000,1500,646,36,108,10,['120000000000000000000'],['0x442e218bb1fdc5450be14e200d225b39ce644e4a'],[''],16846798,1679047175,0x3759efe3826a35ab1e4a8e7b234be982f468d8ed2f1ea08da15dfa25d195c5f6,['0x'],0xdcb4117e3a00632efcac3c169e0b23959f555e5e

**Hi, I’m [Noun 64](https://twitter.com/dorculas) 👋**

In this proposal, I want to create a unique and inspiring moment in time for all of Nouns to rally around. I believe Nouns is one of the best storytelling protocols as it provides the opportunity for anyone to add to that story in a very meaningful way to proliferate the meme. With Aaron “Wheelz” Fotheringham and my team, we will create a story that will capture the hearts and minds of Nouners and people outside of the Nouns ecosystem alike and provide on-chain lore for future creatives to play around with.

**TL;DR:**
- Create a 5-7 minute Nounish documentary that dives into Wheelz' amazing story and follows him in his journey to do **the first triple back flip in a wheelchair**
- Produce raw content and b-roll around the entire project to be released as CC0 on [everydayforever.wtf](http://everydayforever.wtf)
- Upon completion, we will submit a droposal to have the documentary minted as an Open Edition where 50% of proceeds go to NounsDAO and the other 50% of proceeds go to Life Rolls On

![https://i.imgur.com/DZDkKRm.png](https://i.imgur.com/DZDkKRm.png)

When I first started ideating what I wanted to do with my first proposal, I thought back on all of the people I’ve met that resonated with my interpretation of the idea of Nounishness and Wheelz was one of the first people I thought of. He’s an incredibly genuine human that lives life in an absolutely full send way. He’s been on tour with Nitro Circus, participated in X Games, holds multiple Guinness World Records and has been featured on ESPN, CNN, and Bleacher Report.

I asked him one day, “what’s something crazy you want to do?” He responded with, “I’ve wanted to do the first triple back flip in a wheelchair for a while now but haven’t gotten the time to work on it.” I got goosebumps and immediately started figuring out how we could make this reality.

**What are we doing with Wheelz?**

We will create a Nounish documentary that follows Wheelz through the journey of executing **the first triple back flip on a wheelchair**. A doc that gives you a window into Wheelz’ story and the story of him doing the unimaginable - filled with joy and perseverance but doesn’t take itself too seriously. This story will serve as a piece of Nouns lore to be enjoyed and to be forked for future Nounish content.

To execute this, we will first need a mega ramp. Luckily, we’ve connected with a mega ramp builder that has built ramps for the likes of X Games and Nitro Circus and he’s willing to rent his ramp to us for our short doc.

Here’s the crazy 30-foot mega ramp that we would be using:

![https://i.imgur.com/eWSeRKg.png](https://i.imgur.com/eWSeRKg.png)

The ramp is awesome, right? Next, we need a team that is capable of producing a Nounish documentary. This is why I’m bringing in Zack Patrick - who is a talented friend of mine that can handle all aspects of this documentary from the action sports videography to the drone footage to the storytelling. Below you can find some of his amazing work:

![https://i.imgur.com/BfqqSRN.png](https://i.imgur.com/BfqqSRN.png)

I will be working with Zack on the storyboard, taking heavy inspiration from the Nouns creative content funded and created before us. Like I said above, this documentary will be as Nounish as possible - joyful, creative, inspirational yet it doesn’t take itself too seriously.

In addition, we will Nounify the entire documentary by procuring a Nounish custom wheelchair, Nounish marketing materials for the mega ramp, a large inflatable pair of Noggles to have on set of the triple back flip, and some Nounish goods already created and funded via NounsDAO. 

![https://i.imgur.com/mR5OivM.png](https://i.imgur.com/mR5OivM.png)

When we finish the short doc, we will premiere it on Youtube and Twitter and then send a droposal to the DAO to release it as an open edition where 50% of the proceeds will go back to NounsDAO and the other 50% will go to Life Rolls On - a non-profit organization picked by Wheelz that is dedicated to improving the quality of life for young people affected by spinal cord injury and utilizes action sports as a platform for inspiring the infinite possibilities beyond paralysis. 

We will also launch [everydayforever.wtf](http://everydayforever.wtf) as a CC0 repository for select footage we take during this process. We want to encourage collaboration and inspire creators to experiment with all of this Nounish content we’re creating. As part of the proposal, we will also be managing, maintaining and expanding on the collection of Nouns CC0 material on everydayforever.wtf for a year.

**Timeline**

Our aim is to have everything delivered within 6 months at the latest. 

**The Future**

What a great thing to think about. I hope to tell more awesome stories about Nounish folks in my life and bring them into the ever-growing Nouns Universe. Leveling up with each proposal, making you all smile and having fun is the goal.

With [everydayforever.wtf](http://everydayforever.wtf) I want to collect and aggregate as much Nounish CC0 material in one place so that anyone from anywhere can build on top of the magic we’re building here.

## TL;DR

Bring the Nouns Fair and introduce the Nouns Prize to six ETHGlobal IRL hackathons. Let’s be where developers, creatives, and entrepreneurs gather to build. The Nouns Fair is the space to have fun, experience culture, build, and proliferate Nouns all at once!

## WTF?

> **The Nouns Fair is an IRL experience that aims to spread Nouns among hackers and builders in web3.**

As ETHGlobal states, they are growing the most valuable developer community in web3. At their hackathons, engineers, designers, and product leaders come together for three days to collaborate on building something amazing. The Nouns Fair is a dedicated space for them inside the hackathon where we create a fun nounish atmosphere. This makes Nouns associated with a positive and memorable experience.

The Nouns Fair serves different purposes to help hackers learn about Nouns:

- **Awareness** – hackers taking pictures at our photo sets and wearing cool Nounish swag
- **Learning** – we spend three full days answering questions about all things nounish
- **Building** – there will be a pool of 5k in prizes for nounish projects

> **The Nouns Fair is perfect for creating a builders’ cycle on a weekend.
Awareness > Learning > Building > Proliferation > Awareness > …**

We can’t miss this opportunity to put Nouns in the eyes of thousands of talented hackers!

![](https://i.imgur.com/yiRMrzj.png)

## So far…

We’ve hosted three editions of the Nouns Fair at ETHGlobal hackathons: in Mexico, Colombia, and the USA. After three editions we've confirmed the importance of this kind of event to increase awareness, onboard potential builders, and put noggles in the eyes of thousands. 

We managed to put Nouns and noggles in the eyes of:

- 3,700 people in
- 3 cities: Mexico City, Bogota, and San Francisco, during
- 9 full days of nounishness with
- 3 Nouns Fair editions

All this blended with the local culture:

- Piñatas
- Games
- Candies
- Fortune cookies with nounish luck and a
- Nouns flower power VW bus

We also distributed nounish swag, including:

- 800 t-shirts
- 600 pins
- 1,600 stickers
- 400 POAPs

## What do people say about the Nouns Fair?

Hundreds of people have enjoyed previous editions of the Nouns Fair. Their faces of joy smashing piñatas, getting candies, winning a T-shirt for playing foosball and just having a good time taking pictures with giant noun heads and learning about Nouns says it all! – We asked a few folks to tell us a bit of their experience at the Nouns Fair.

![](https://i.imgur.com/48wpqHW.png)

## What is the plan?

**The Nouns Fair will be a cultural experience focused on builders where they will be able to engage with others, learn and build with Nouns.** These activations will be localized nounish experiences with photo opportunities, games, swag, and dedicated hosts answering every question about Nouns and building.

We want to keep onboarding international builders and help others create on top of Nouns. To do so, we plan to go to six IRL ETHGlobal hackathons forecasted for 2023.

1. **[ETHGlobal Lisbon ↗︎](https://ethglobal.com/events/lisbon)**: May 12 → May 14 
2. **[ETHGlobal Waterloo ↗︎](https://ethglobal.com/events/waterloo2023)**: June 23 → June 25
3. **[ETHGlobal Paris ↗︎](https://ethglobal.com/events/paris2023)**: July 21 → July 23
4. **[ETHGlobal New York ↗︎](https://ethglobal.com/events/newyork2023)**: September 22 → September 24
5. **[ETHGlobal Istambul ↗︎](https://ethglobal.com/events/istanbul)**: November (TBC)
6. ETHGlobal Devcon: Q4 (TBC)

Countries and dates may change during the year. We’ll adjust accordingly as things unfold.

![](https://i.imgur.com/X5XHeIZ.jpg)

## What to expect?

After three editions, we now know that making people's first experience with Nouns fun and meaningful makes the perfect environment to be receptive about wtf is Nouns, how the DAO works, and how people can collaborate. 

This year we'll focus on making builders build with Nouns by doubling our efforts on incentivizing them to materialize their ideas with Nouns from the start. We’ll introduce a new way to learn the nounish vibe and encourage people to build in-site with Nouns: the **Nouns Prize.**

### **Nouns Prize – wtf?**

People hacking at the event will get a chance to learn about Nouns by going to the Nouns Fair inside the venue. They will learn they can build on top of Nouns immediately at the hackathon and be rewarded. This is a way to showcase the nounish vibe and incentivize the use of Nouns to build whatever they can imagine. Hundreds of hackers building with Nouns all at once like a massive Nouns Prop House flash round – can you picture that?

This prize aims to reward builders that:

1. Use Nouns art
2. Build for the Nouns community
3. Build public goods using Nouns

**Doing this at every hackathon will help to a) have a dedicated window to onboard hundreds of skilled builders, b) get familiar with the Nouns’ culture, and c) incentivize building constantly.** 

> **More builders, more props, more proliferation.**

Imagine hackers building with Nouns as they already do with protocols and tools like Polygon, Lens, MetaMask, Uniswap, Aave, etc.

![](https://i.imgur.com/b60kgr5.png)

### Culture á la Nounish

The Nouns Fair's experience results from great design, excellent execution, and blending of cultures. We wrap all this in a concept we call **culture á la nounish**.

We've done it differently in each country. In Mexico City, we did it with rustic hand-painted fair stands, games, candies, and nouns piñatas. In Bogota, with a high-quality printed stage highlighting local cultural imagery along with traditional games, toys, and candies. And in San Francisco, with a 60's flower power VW bus and custom Chinese fortune cookies. All this with a pinch of swag. 

We'll keep blending local culture with Nouns in this year's editions of the Nouns Fair. We're excited about the richness of culture this year's locations will bring.

> **Proliferation and culture á la nounish**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/JIEHA7N.jpg)

## What is the budget?

With the experience we’ve had in the previous Fairs, we’ve kept what works best and made some changes, adapting both to each city’s event expectations and social media needs + the Nouns Prize for hackers.

To make this reality, **we ask for $226,425 USDC worth in funding**, which we'll allocate as follows.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7MSFqnV.png)

*Note 1: The Photo Set, Culture à la Nounish, and Traveling & Accommodation sections are considering a 5% buffer to cover potential changes in prices and schedules throughout the year.*

*Note 2: For security, all funds will be managed by a 3/5 Safe (0xFB35d8B136729D3aB74d687E482F3D16CE18d89C) including Ale, Mono, the Nouns Fair wallet, [Necfas ↗︎](https://twitter.com/necfas), and [Franklin ↗︎](https://twitter.com/franklinvargas).* 

## Who are we?

- [Mono, Nouns Amigos nounder ↗︎](https://twitter.com/0xMonografia)

We want to turn the Nouns Fair into a vehicle that can proliferate and attract builders anywhere in the world. We've done it in three countries and want to keep adding more this year.

We are two nounders of Nouns Amigos, the community for all Spanish speakers. We onboard, encourage, and help our amigos to build with Nouns. We are nounifying Latin America and beyond.

We've been active with Nouns Amigos since June 2022. We've done weekly Twitter Spaces since then (now part of the regular TNS Soapbox schedule), three editions of the Nouns Fair, and [created Nouns Amigos hub in Prop House ↗︎](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos) which has funded 19 props in two months including [two breakdancers that want to qualify for the Olympics in 2024 ↗︎](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/ronda-1/3281), [a giant skateboarding noggles rail in the Dominican Republic ↗︎](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/ronda-1/3360), [these Godzilla-size Nouns in the streets of Bogota ↗︎](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/ronda-1/3368), [8 Meetups in 5 Latam countries ↗︎](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/reuniones-a-la-nounish), [sponsored a sub-champion MBT racer ↗︎](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/mantente-nounish/3748), [sponsored an Ethereum Guatemala conference ↗︎](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/mantente-nounish/3705) and [more ↗︎](https://woolen-sapphire-e03.notion.site/January-March-2023-d4aceb12e9a44a56960bc8639afd5675)!

But most of all, we've gathered the Spanish community on [Twitter ↗︎](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos) and [Discord ↗︎](https://discord.gg/MDvvuUkNYT) under Nouns Amigos!

### Preface
I'm sponsoring this prop because I believe in the initiative, but have no involvement beyond sponsorship. Please direct any questions and conversation to the builders proposing - Brian and Bloomz.


## TLDR 

We're requesting 10 ETH to make Nouns DAO a Title Partner of W3BSTOCK NYC, a global live entertainment consortium that empowers artists and revolutionizes the music industry using blockchain technology. By partnering with W3BSTOCK, Nouns DAO will gain significant exposure and align itself with the top-tier global web3 music and arts ecosystem, which is growing rapidly in New York City. The partnership will involve Noun-focused activations, merchandise, and branding throughout the event, targeting a diverse audience of over 1,500 attendees, and providing long-term value to the Nouns community.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZaAkO29.jpg)

## Intro

NOUN YORK CITY 2023!!!

GM Fellow Nouners! 

At W3BSTOCK, our core mission is to proliferate live music and beautiful art into a wider consciousness while providing creators with the tools to pave a more equitable music industry. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, we are spreading education around these tools and showing creators how to drive new forms of revenue, fan engagement, and artistic expression. We believe that by empowering artists, we empower the world, disrupting the outdated music industry and creating a more vibrant and equitable future for all involved. We would LOVE for the Nouns DAO to join us on this exciting journey to revolutionize the world of music and art.

We are a NYC-based, global live entertainment consortium powering the decentralized music industry, with a core team from diverse live entertainment production entities like Brooklyn Bowl, Relix Magazine, The Capitol Theatre, Lockn' Music Festival, Central Park Summerstage and Universal Music and from artistic and musical members of bluechip NFT communities like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Crypto Punks (Spottie Wifi is in the DAO), Gutter Cat Gang, Nouns, Lil Nouns, The Visitors, The Alien Boy, and many more. Our organization integrates best-in-class web3 tools and communities to produce concerts, music festivals and other meaningful, memorable experiences in real life, all doubled in the metaverse, all framed around a global mission to fix the live music industry through blockchain to create a better future for creators, venues, event organizers and fans. 

Following the successful Nouns activations at W3BSTOCK Miami on December 1st, 2022 and the W3BSTOCK x Lil Nouns Denver party on March 4th, 2023. We now have the opportunity for Nouns to make a lasting impression within the W3BSTOCK live music and arts ecosystem, which will reverberate across the thriving New York City web3 community in the artistic and musical epicenter of NFT.NYC and beyond. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/Y0Cyr22.jpg)

## Event 

W3BSTOCK will kick off NFT.NYC this year on the eve of the conference, Tuesday, April 11th with a massive event bringing together over 40 leading music acts from the web3 music ecosystem like Dyl, Rae Isla, Domino, Violetta Zironi, Nifty Sax, The CART3L, Fifi Rong, Jadyn Violet, and Taylor Alexander, and over 30 high profile NFT tastemakers like Dave Krugman / ALLSHIPS, KYD Labs, Aptos, Metasill, Tokenprooof, and many more - This is the biggest lineup of web3 artists playing a single stage in history and we have the opportunity to get the Nouns DAO front and center of not only the NYC event, but the big picture mission at the core of W3BSTOCK: To proliferate live music and beautiful art into a wider consciousness.

W3BSTOCK was hands down the most popular music and art event the day before NFT NYC last year and I expect this year will be no different. With an expected attendance of over 30,000 attendees at NFT.NYC this year, W3BSTOCK realistically projects an attendance of over 1,500 educated, diverse attendees for their event, including in-person attendees and metaverse attendees with organic social media impressions exceeding 20,000. 

**Note:** the vast majority of the NYC web3 music community are NOT widely aware of the Nouns DAO and what we are doing - hence the opportunity.

This is an unprecedented opportunity to align the Nouns community with the top tier global web3 music and arts ecosystem that is emerging from New York and rapidly spreading around the world. We will onboard new community members from the W3BSTOCK music and art community into the Nouns DAO, and we will ensure that the Nouns are tethered inextricably to the paradigm shift that is just beginning for artists and creators. 

This is a different type of NFT event. It is solely focused on live music, beautiful performances, and interactive art activations, rather than a dry panel of speakers or a bunch of speculative crypto bros. 

W3BSTOCK has already proliferated incredible web3-enabled music and arts programming in New York, Las Vegas, Miami and London, with forthcoming parties coming up at Bitcoin 2022 in May and at W3BSTOCK Sydney in August. For this reason, I would like Nouns to have a leading presence at this event, so that the Nouns will continue to be a leading cultural tastemaker in this good-to-grey web3 music ecosystem over the long term.

## Description

We are requesting 10 ETH for **Nouns** to become a **Title Partner** of W3BSTOCK NYC with a complete Nounish takeover of the entire event, including a fully Nounish Photo Booth with a direct social media integration. We will also get Noggles on leading web3 music influencers like Dyl, Violetta Zironi, Rae Isla, and more, on the eve of the conference so they can rock them for the remainder of NFT week and aid in the cultural Nouns proliferation. This will make a large splash and kick off a week of Nounish proliferation at NFT NYC and will also generate loads of awareness for Nouns DAO and their mission.

The funding breakdown will be as follows:

10 ETH For Title Partnership that will get us:
* Premiere, exclusive sponsorship of the event which would make it the official Nouns NFT NYC kickoff event
*  20’x20’ Official Tastemaker IRL Vendor Booth, placed prominently at the main entrance to the event with 2 dedicated 33” Metasill screen and projector to display Nouns NFTs at the front and center of the event

## ROI To The DAO:

I will show the DAO several returns on investment from this activation from financial, to brand awareness, to growth marketing. I will be collecting data via POAP mints, distributed merch to holders, and social media impressions. We will keep a thorough list of tags on every social platform, Nouns.wtf and nouns.wft link visits during the week, and will provide a full write-up on all of the nounish interactions with artists and creators and the W3BSTOCK event and across NFT NYC. 

I will provide a total of **3 reports to the DAO**. The reports will provide **follow up analytics after 7 days, 30 days and 90 days**. The stats I will be tracking are:

•**Branding and proliferation** of Noggles all across NFT.NYC with an estimated 20,000 organic social impressions
• **Hundreds of photos** of W3BSTOCK and Nouns and other nounish people at the step-and-repeat including leading web3 music and cultural influencers
• **Website Traffic** to Nouns.wtf 
• **Purchases** - We will have a number of POAP kiosks throughout the event where attendees will mint our Nouns @ W3BSTOCK NFT NYC POAP. Through this, we will have a list of wallet addresses that I will then check those addresses at the 7 day, 30 day and 90 day checkpoints to see if any of those wallet addresses now own a Noun (purchased after the event date)
• **Photos** either tagging Lil Nouns or Nouns and/or containing Noggles, pulled from every social media platform at 30, 90 and 180s out from the event.
• **Aggregated brand impressions** from all social media, web visits and NFT purchases post event at each checkpoint

By proliferating Nouns and Lil Nouns at W3BSTOCK Miami and also our collab Denver event, and also knowing all about W3BSTOCK last NYC event at the same venue, I have been able to see first hand how to best proliferate the nounish brands among the W3BSTOCK arts and music ecosystem. The biggest impacts include:

• **Interactive art**, screens and live minting POAP experiences, and step-and-repeat activations
• **A strong presence** at the event with a premium booth & Noun maxis to chat with & answer questions
• **Live music** - This has been oft overlooked in building the Nouns communities and I believe we have massively untapped awareness within the thriving web3 NYC music and arts web3 scene - This proposal will instantly fix that
• **Branded tote gift bags** handed out to holders 
• **Stickers** - people love collecting stickers and we saw tons of them up around various places in Miami and Denver
• **T-shirts** - Branded W3BSTOCK x Nouns t-shirts turn attendees into marketing evangelists, and people who come to events and have a great time (like, all of them) are happy to wear merch around to other events at conferences and also post on social media  

If this proposal is funded we will officially be partnering with the first-to-market and leading web3 music and arts ecosystem which is thriving in New York City. This will allow allow for nounish proliferation over an entire week, not only in W3BSTOCK’s live music and arts ecosystem, but in and around the largest NFT conference in the entire world, in the greatest city in the world, **NOUN YORK CITY!!!!**

## Conclusion

The music industry has long been plagued by problems that hurt artists and fans, and this is the most ripe space for blockchain disruption, and this particular use case and demographic has been largely overlooked by the Nouns DAO .... until now. 

We believe that blockchain technology is poised to create a more equitable future for artists, fans, and industry professionals alike. By leveraging the power of blockchain, we're able to provide a platform that enables direct artist-to-fan engagement and fair revenue distribution, cutting out middlemen and gatekeepers who have historically taken a large chunk of the profits. Our organization also provides creators with new ways to monetize their work, such as through NFTs and fan token offerings, creating new forms of revenue streams that were previously unavailable.

Like the Nouns, at W3BSTOCK, we're not just speculating about the possibilities of blockchain technology - we're making it a reality. This is why we believe that a partnership like this would represent such a mutual value and bear very long term fruit for the Nouns and independent creators across the globe. 

I believe that one of the core focuses in our shared goal of proliferation the Nouns DAO should be empowering creators, and what better way than to proliferate Nouns to artists and musicians? These are the truest arbiters of culture. Musicians and artists say what is cool, they define culture. We get leading web3 artists and musicians rocking the Nouns brand ... and the world will follow. 

By getting involved with W3BSTOCK, we'll be at the forefront of a music, art, and creator revolution, disrupting the outmoded music industry and creating a more equitable future for all involved. 

Thank you for considering this proposal, and here's to a brighter future for music, art and the world!

*- [ToneSegurado's winning entry](https://prop.house/nouns-stories/nouns-short-shorts-season-1)*

## TLDR
We're asking for **$65,000 USDC** to be spent on funding 7 more Short Shorts and hosting / livestreaming an IRL festival event in LA to showcase and celebrate our amazing Nounish animators.

## PROGRESS UPDATE

This project was originally funded through [**Prop 180**](https://nouns.wtf/vote/180), and we have since selected 10 animators to participate in the first ever **Nouns Short Shorts** festival. We received coverage from [**Animation Magazine**](https://www.animationmagazine.net/2023/03/stoopid-buddy-teams-with-nouns-dao-to-fund-nft-inspired-short-shorts/) and have a simple [**Nouns Stories**](http://nounsstories.wtf/) website with further links.

5 of these animators were selected through our [**Prop House round**](https://prop.house/nouns-stories/nouns-short-shorts-season-1), which is now complete. We had 67 wildly talented applicants offering a variety of animation styles: 2D, 3D, stop motion, mixed media. The Prop House link has all of the submissions, including the 5 winners.

At the same time, our team commissioned 5 additional animators from our personal networks. We are excited to announce them - they are fantastic animators with significant careers and social followings. After this proposal we will announce all animators together in a press release.

Both the Prop House round and commissions have successfully caught the attention of world-class animators. We are onboarding some very talented people to Nouns, even helping some set up their first crypto wallets. It feels like we've hit on something special.

## FUNDING MORE SHORT SHORTS

Many great creators applied to the Prop House round and selecting only 5 was a challenge. We would love to fund a few additional Short Shorts from this pool of talent, as well as commission some more from our own networks. This extra animated content will be very useful for the IRL film festival we're planning.

We're looking for $52,500 USDC to fund 7 more animations:

 - 5 additional Prop House shorts ($7500 USDC x 5)
 - 2 additional comissioned shorts ($7500 USDC x 2)

## HOSTING IRL FESTIVAL IN LA

Excited by the caliber of animators, we would like to rent a venue in Los Angeles and host an IRL festival event. The organizing team has significant connections in the LA Animation / Film industries and we plan to invite our professional networks, friends, and the general public to enjoy some Short Shorts and learn about Nouns. We will screen all of the commissioned animations and other Nounish videos. The event will be livestreamed for anyone around the world to enjoy.

The budget will cover things like venue rental, event staff, audiovisual equipment, food/drink, and further marketing costs as they pop up.

IRL Festival budget - $12,500 USDC

## THE FUTURE

This first round of animations and the festival event are a pilot for a decentralized, CC0 Nouns festival dream. We intend to develop Nouns Short Shorts into a recurring global phenomenon, an infinite stream of animated Nounish content.

## BUDGET

7 x Short Shorts - $52,500 USDC

**Forgeries - ALL are FAKE except ONE** is the debut release for Omega, a brand new public goods hyperstructure deployed on Ethereum by [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), [Iain](https://twitter.com/isiain), [Emre](https://twitter.com/emrecolako) and [Jordan](https://twitter.com/jordanpunzalann) – ie.

- Droposal only; no funding request
- Omega deployed as a free public good
- Attached tx deploys Zora timed open edition
- The editions are Noun 401 counterfeits
- One withdraws Noun from escrow

## 💽 Forgeries

Inspired by MSCHF's drop, [Museum of Forgeries](https://moforgeries.org/), we're effectively mixing the real Noun 401 into an open edition of exact forgeries. Once the drop is complete, minters authenticate through a Japanese gameshow style experience.

![](https://zora-prod.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafybeifpissycinwptwf7iwmrkffiamidofp66l6snql5zjo33nsbks42i)

What we have built to power Forgeries is open source and free to use. Anyone can deploy their own contracts from Omega to create unique experiences. Everything is fair, transparent and verifiably random thanks to [Chainlink VRF](https://chain.link/vrf)!

## 📺 Omega

An extensive [public audit contest](https://code4rena.com/contests/2022-12-forgeries-contest) was completed on code4rena, with 77 auditors earning their share of a 36,500 USDC prize pool. Since then we’ve implemented patches for all vulnerabilities found, made various optimisations and prepared the protocol for mainnet. All of the code is open source and can be found in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/0xigami/forgeries-contracts).

](https://twitter.com/defdao/status/1626655069906128896)

Our vision is a multiplayer future for crypto and we firmly believe NFTs are the building blocks. By providing public goods infrastructure to the community we can empower developers, artists, collectors, projects and DAOs to unlock a new design space for creative onchain experiences. 

## 💾 C:ollab 

We are fostering a supportive community around Omega and look forward to helping fund the creation of new experiences. Prop House infinite rounds will provide the ideal platform, while our editions will function well as voting tokens. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/CnCF3Xy.jpg)

[Permissionless collabs](https://permissionlesscollabs.com) (if you're installed, you're in) and in future, perhaps, a nounish DAO to serve as the steward of our new protocol. But first there are various upgrades and extensions we have planned to make the system as trustless as possible. 

## 🕹 Loading...

We've been working on some very nounish expansion packs for Omega and would love if nounsfolk came to explore with us. Our use of a merkle root layer means that myriad onchain games where it's ""last man standing"" are made possible – Onchain Multiplayer Ether Gaming Action!

### CURRENT SETTINGS
1. **Minimum quorum %:** currently set to 10%
2. **Maximum quorum %:** currently set to 15%
3. **Coefficient:** currently set to 1, such that each against vote raises the quorum requirement by one vote, until the maximum quorum is reached.

### PROPOSED SETTINGS
1. **Minimum quorum %:** 10% (no change)
2. **Maximum quorum %:** set to 20% 
3. **Coefficient:** 1 (no change)

### RATIONALE
1. Dynamic quorum was designed so that contentious proposals would require a higher degree of support. 
2. Maximum quorum is currently too low to have changed the outcome of any recent proposals.
3. Increasing maximum quorum should increase the percentage of successful proposals that are ""hell yes"" initiatives.

### PROPOSAL TRANSACTIONS

1. Minimum quorum BPs: 10% (1000 basis points) (no change).
1. Maximum quorum BPs: 20% (2000 basis points).

* The video displayed will be new content based on materials from the [collection's shoot day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHauDW5BQQY) and including animated Nouns & beautiful transitions.
*  Nouns.wtf will be displayed on these ads.
* High quality videos & stills captured during the air time will be shared on socials.

There's a 50% discount from NFT.NYC to display the video in Times Square, reducing the cost from $30,000 to $15,000.

The video will be played 560 times during the week resulting in 2 hours of airtime. 

The captured photos and videos of the moment will serve as powerful marketing assets for Nouns & to promote the collection further.

In summary, the expenses are as follows:
- **NFT NYC Billboard Package:** $15,000 (after 50% discount)
- **Videographer & Photographer to Create Media From the Event:** $600
- **Video Editing for Various Formats:** $400
- **Total Costs:** $16,000 

The billboard package comprises three prominent Times Square locations:
- One Times Square
- NASDAQ
- MIFI (Midtown Financial)

![Nouns 3D-Printed Collection](https://i.imgur.com/Nvta4fL.png)

Here are the details of what we will receive with the NFT NYC billboard package:

**1-Hour Kickoff Roadblock:**
- Scheduled for April 11th from 8:30 pm to 9:30 pm
- Each 15-second clip will be displayed a total of 25 times across the three billboard screens
- On average, each clip will be showcased six times per billboard screen, amounting to 6 minutes and 15 seconds of airtime

**Week Rotation:**
- Scheduled for April 9th to April 16th
- Each 15-second clip will be presented approximately 560 times in total across the three billboard screens over eight days (resulting in over 2 hours of airtime)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Captured photos and videos will serve as powerful marketing assets for Nouns & to promote the collection further
- The collection's uniqueness will distinguish it from other crypto projects airing at the same time, and represents the Nouns brand well

**Times Square Exposure:**
-  In the past week, 277,669 pedestrian visitors 
- Times Square holds the #1 spot for global check-ins on Instagram
- Visitors spend an average of 8 minutes looking at the billboards

### Updates on the Collection's Impact

I am continuing to [actively promote](https://www.instagram.com/danitpeleg3d/) the collection on my socials and am getting a lot of inbound requests to present and talk about the collection and Nouns DAO. 

In the past month, after the collection's debut in Paris:

* This week the collection [participated](https://www.instagram.com/p/CqYwX7YPBlK/) in the 2023 Metaverse Fashion Week (MVFW) 
* I gave a talk to influential art collectors at [SoHo House](https://twitter.com/danitpeleg3d/status/1636279668771880961) in Tel Aviv

**DreamLeague Season 19**
Our Dota team was invited to a 1 million dollar tournament as one of the 16 best teams in the world. This tournament circuit is ran by ESL, the biggest esports company in the world. Our success at this event will allow us to participate in a 15 million dollar grand final later this year.
![](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/sDgIIzb2UMj-OTHG8G4POauhmFeRE95o3oartDmdi84/https/pbs.twimg.com/media/FrqIBzJWYAEvYSZ.jpg)

**Blast Paris Major 2023 North American RMR** 
The Counter Strike sticker opportunity. Our team is in Monterrey Mexico, competing against top teams from the Americas for a spot at the [Paris Major](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/BLAST/Major/2023/Paris) in May.

**IEM Dallas**
Our CSGO team has qualified for IEM Dallas starting May 29th. IEM Dallas is an S-Tier event just barely below a Major. It will pit Nouns against the worlds best international teams, with hundreds of thousands of viewers. 2022's iteration (pictured below) had over 12.5 million hours watched and a crowd seating thousands.
![](https://i.imgur.com/DmQCdf3.png)

## Proposal Success Metrics & Vision

- Tournament wins and participation
    - Continuing to compete at some of the biggest tournaments in the world, such as Majors and The International
- Viewership 
    - Due to the success of our teams we expect to be at significantly more tier one events than last year. Regular 10K to 100K+ viewership is expected
    - The highest view count so far was 200.000+ live viewers during a nail-biting series against MiBR at the CS:GO NA RMR
- Social media growth
    - Approaching 7000 followers on our main Twitter account & multiple of our players have over 50k followers
    - Discord server with 2400 members in total and a growing group of active contributors
- In-game branding
    - Dota will continue to have Nouns assets thanks to participation in the Pro Circuit
    - In CS, we need to qualify for an upcoming Major, doing so would guarantee permanent Nounish branding inside of the game
- Acquiring additional partners aligned to our Nounish ethos
    - We'll seek partners that share our values and vision for long-term growth, prioritizing alignment with our Nounish ethos
    -  Nouns Esports can have multiple sponsors supporting our competitive initiative, and we will prioritize aligning with sponsors that share our values and vision for long-term growth
- Onboarding
    - Gamers have typically been wary of the crypto space due to a lack of understanding and perceived complexity. However, the similarities between the gaming and crypto ecosystems, such as digital ownership and online communities, make them well-suited for each other
    - Nounish culture extended into esports has proven to be an amazing onboarding tool and we believe we can bridge the gap between gaming and crypto, showing gamers the potential benefits of crypto and its applications in and beyond the gaming world


## Risks and Challenges

As an organization, it's crucial to consider the potential risks associated with discontinuing support for our esports teams. These teams are not just a source of entertainment for the community but also a representation of our brand and values. If we abruptly stop supporting them, we risk losing the trust and loyalty of the community we have worked hard to build.

Another challenge that esports teams face is potential fluctuations in performance during the competitive season. To mitigate this risk, it's important to provide necessary support expected of tier one rosters, including management, coaching, bootcamps, and wellness support. This helps maintain the players' focus, discipline, and motivation, especially during challenging times.

## Budget

Funding two professional esports teams for a minimum of 10 months.

#### **Rosters**
- 340,000 - 465,000 USDC
    - Two teams consisting of five players and one coach (12 people in total)
    - 125000 reserved for incentive payments, meaning it will be reflexive of the performance and effort put forth by the teams

#### **Bootcamps** 
- 20,000-120,000 USDC
- Funding the best practice opportunities prior to important competitions
     - Considered an essential need for top esports rosters
     - Costs may be reduced depending on the number of sponsored bootcamps (e.g. our Dota team has already received a free bootcamp in Europe during April, paid for by the organizers)

#### **Support Staff**
- 210,000 USDC
    - We are providing industry-standard support staff for these rosters
        - Two player managers who travel to events with the teams & organize their lives around regular competition
        - Professional wellness staff 
        - Support staff for logistics, social media & content

#### **Total: 795,000 USDC** (~435 ETH at current prices)
---
### **Multisig**

We will be using the same multisig that was created for [Proposal 119](https://nouns.wtf/vote/119) consisting of Nouners and Nounsfolk. We will be swapping in Esports Pod member Peter as an active signer.

- Sasquatch
- Brennen
- Maty
- Oni
- [Peter](https://twitter.com/Peterpandam) (Former [Dota Pro](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Ppd), winner of The International, and previously CEO of [Evil Geniuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Geniuses))

## Esports, Introduced
We have recently created a fun & free open edition to celebrate Nouns Esports, which has been minted over 10,000 times (with a limit of 1 per wallet)! 
- *We have re-opened the mint for the duration of this proposal, you can find it at [mint.nouns.gg](mint.nouns.gg)*

Hi Nouners, we are planning to propose launching a Nouns Vacation Summer Brand for this summer.

We are an experienced team capable of end-to-end operation (design, production, marketing, event-hosting) of the brand. Please find the details below and it would be really helpful if you let us know your opinions before we submit the actual proposal.

* Proliferation activities with the brand fashion wear and lifestyle goods will happen in Summer 2023, at beach, stores, and festivals around South Korea
___
## Introduction
* Beach, sun, and watersports have proven to fit well with the image and vibe of Nouns as Nouns have done successful proliferation through beach cleanups, crypto events in Miami/LA, and sailing competitions in Seoul and soon in NYC. An even more effective way to build upon this is to produce, distribute, and promote Nouns beach-themed wears and products for the public.

* This is to manufacture summer themed Nouns Vacation (name subject to change) goods for 2023 (10+ type of products), including 4+ wears, 4+ accessories, and 2+ lifestyle items as shown in the initial concept images below
Proliferation activities, including beach cleanup, pop-up store, and booth sponsors, for marketing and branding of the manufactured goods will follow.

* This can also be tied to other Nouns proposals, such as providing the goods to the Nouns Sailing team, Nouns beach clean up volunteers, and other Nouns-related events.

* The team that would lead this is from a South Korea-based fashion retailer, who produce and distribute 4 clothing brand names, and has the resources, network, and channels built in place to work on this from Day 1 and can confidently execute the products by the proposed deadline of June 2023.

[Not a real design, for marketing only. Better design plan below.]

---

As one of the primary means of interacting with our online world, keyboards are more than just a tool – they've become a personal expression. Until Neuralink becomes available, let's design a keyboard that we love to use every time!

NextMech and I are excited to create a Nounish Mechanical Keyboard (MK) in collaboration with a top tier keyboard designers. With our internal MK knowledge and technical ability, we have planned a project that ultimately launches a Nouns sub-DAO for an enthusiastic subculture!

### Overview

Over the years, [an online subculture has emerged (partial MK ecosystem stats)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing) that cherishes their custom keyboards as works of art. This community has developed its own workflow called the group buy, where artists share designs for collectors to pre-order. After pooling the funds, the designer approaches a vendor to manufacture and deliver the product. Similar to web3, projects are decentralized across social media and different websites, [and they also have meetups around the world](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query)! Using the existing manufacturing infrastructure, we can improve the UX by utilizing NFTs, DAOs, and open-source software, to bridge the two communities!

![MK_meet](https://i.imgur.com/p8ph93F.jpg)
[SF meet March 5th 2023 with a photoshoped Nouns MK - [original photo](https://twitter.com/villi/status/1632132746029182977)]
Other meetups can be seen by searching for [""mechanical keyboard meet""](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query).

### Us

NextMech and I (profish) began working on a project called Mechies which won a small prize in a 2022 Australian hackathon. We thought about MK NFTs in the form of generative art with manufacturable traits, DAOs as Vendors for group buys, hardware-embedded signatures, etc., to help improve the ecosystem. Then, at the beginning of this year, we were introduced to [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami) through a buildoors group in Australia. He told us about the profound model of Nouns, and it quickly became clear that a collaboration would help proliferate the brand and support the MK subculture. His tremendous support and knowledge has helped shape a sustainable plan for this project!

### Nouns x MKs

The proliferation synergizes immediately with existing channels. For example, the Nouns Esports team could incorporate the keycaps in their battle stations which would reach gaming spectators - expression of support have been made for collaboration. Or, Nouns keycaps can be given as POAPs to hackathon participants and winners, Nouns keyboards would be taken to keyboard meet ups around the world, photos of Nouns keyboards and keycaps will be showcased on popular online forum with millions of visitors, and so on. But we plan to go further than these channels and use Zora's Nouns Builder to create a MK DAO and continue to support MK enthusiasts!

### Future

The MK DAO and the general infrastructure supported by this grant can become a platform that improves group buys for designers and collectors. Designers can leverage NFTs to offer their work as mints. They can go further by turning their existing Discord communities into DAOs, where the community can have greater input and ownership in the products they purchase. Also, the collectors who mint these designs benefit from the social media integration of NFTs, for better showcasing of their collections. In fact, we have already begun curating this platform by commissioning different MK artists in the current process, with many more collaborations in the pipeline!

Also, a long-term experiment that we are considering involves addressing IP issues in the ecosystem. [Designers face a challenge in protecting their intellectual property (IP) when running group buys](https://www.theverge.com/22905351/mechanical-keyboard-keycap-clones-imitators-knockoffs-olivia-biip). While stopping counterfeits for keycaps and general products is very difficult, authenticating the keyboards may be feasible. By using [VIA, an open-source software integrated with all keyboards](https://www.caniusevia.com/) and working with manufacturers, we could link keyboards to NFTs for potentially increasing their social and monetary value for collectors.

### Summary Plan

We will work with a top tier MK designer and manufacture the keyboards for the NFT minters. We aim to sell and manufacture 1-2k units with a unique marketing strategy that involves selling keycaps of various sorts to complement the keyboard. This provides an incentive for us to proliferate Nouns, reduce prices and gather foundational members for the MK DAO!

Finally, the entirety of this project will be a great example of real-world adoption for NFTs, especially with the new [EIPs for physical NFTs](https://medium.com/@ABCDE.com/abcde-after-studying-all-eips-we-summarized-9-future-directions-of-nfts-648c11f16a4f). It will be a major win for Nouns to be early and supportive of a devoted subculture that is growing! Take, for example, the subscriber count for the /r/MechanicalKeyboards subreddit:
![MK_subreddit_stats](https://i.imgur.com/ynIRz2l.png)
[Here is a small data set that we have gathered on the ecosystem to provide more context.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing)

**With that said, here is a simple cost breakdown to make it all possible. We have already begun tracking expenses in our Notion and will continue to do so for the rest of the project. If there is a surplus we will allocate to other productive activities that further the project. More detailed breakdown and Q&A at the end:**

- 52 ETH for manufacturing setup of however many mints but a guaranteed amount of 260 units including buffer, prototypes and YouTuber review units. With couple hundred spare keycap sets.
- 10 ETH for assembling (80+ hours of labor), storage until redemption and safe high priority shipping.
- 21.69 ETH for marketing of digital and physical assets including keycap airdrops of various different types.
- 35 ETH for team and contractors, managing production, technical, graphics and starting/supporting the MK DAO.

**Total - 118.69 ETH**

## Detailed Plan
Custom keyboard manufacturing involves two main components: the case and keycap set. Switches and other components are also significant, but they are less customizable; therefore, we will simply use enthusiast-grade products. For a more detailed overview of mechanical keyboards, [check out this intro made by NextMech](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gRH83pF1RBXW6Eve_OLC9Fb7hAlxQQEP/view?usp=sharing).

To start, a designer will incorporate the Nouns brand into the keyboard canvas. We are considering a collaboration with several designer who can create an aesthetic Nouns-themed keyboard. These designers can combine the MK culture and Nouns brand for a pleasing design. These include [BIIP](https://instagram.com/biipmk), [NoPunIn10Did](https://nopunin10did.com/kat-napoleonic/), [sourmk](https://www.instagram.com/sourmk), pikku-allu, dededecline who would be able to combine different themes into their work. Also, a design by a top artist plays a major role for introducing Nouns to the MK community, ensuring a high-quality product that enthusiasts will enjoy. Here are some of the works by the mentioned designers:

For manufacturing, our first choice is a company that builds based on their available catalog of cases and can also assist with packaging and shipping. However, for a better quality design, we are prepared to carry out a more bespoke model by working with different suppliers. NextMech has experience with both approaches and after accounting for trade-offs and constraints, we are confident on delivering a high quality product. The bespoke approach will start at a higher unit cost, but it's still within the financial plan. Also, it's well worth trading off additional costs for a better design!

After finalizing the design, we will begin reviewing prototypes from the manufacturer(s) to confirm the colors and build quality. This will give us the confidence to replicate the design as an NFT, one that will be minted through after a project update. The mint will be priced at approximately 0.3-0.4 ETH depending on final unit cost and ETH price, with a discount for Nouns holders which brings price to near cost. It will have boolean-based redemption on [nouns.mk](https://nouns.MK) since we don't want to burn the NFT so that it can be shared online, and also allows for over the air updates through VIA software.

Prior to and during the minting of the NFTs, we will launch marketing efforts to increase the visibility of the project. Proliferating the brand through community activity which also aligns with our incentive to reduce unit costs. A portion of the mint will be used to help start the MK DAO built using Zora's Noun Builder. We will support the MK DAO by managing further collaboration and manufacturing processes. Also, in addition to the daily auctions for the DAO, people who participated in the physical marketing events will gain access some access to the DAO.

You can start participating by [minting the momento NFT](https://zora.co/collections/0xbe11ce87505d41b6848f37cba26820d89b060a3e) where the glasses will be [magnetic](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp0Q-juJ-_Y/?img_index=1)! Some participants will win this with their keyboard!
[![noun_keycap_board](https://i.imgur.com/06G1uuC.png)](https://zora.co/collections/0xbe11ce87505d41b6848f37cba26820d89b060a3e)

The physical marketing is in the style of MK communities, which will be on in addition to the digital media marketing. We are working on various exciting strategies for minters; some include resin keycaps with 3D Nouns characters inside, two piece magnetic and modular keycaps, novelty keycaps with Nouns themes, high-quality metallic keycaps, a fully custom 1/1 keyboard made for auction, hackathon POAP keycaps redeemed in person and more MK designer and influencer collaborations! These will have various pricing mechanisms to maximize accessibility for collectors and start the MK DAO.

Here are some examples (not a real design) of a Nouns keycap NFT for physical marketing, which can be redeemed in the same way as the main keyboard NFT. It's a great addition to the custom keyboard once it arrives, or it allows MK enthusiasts to join the community with their existing keyboard!

![noun_keycap_board](https://i.imgur.com/xON1kBh.jpg)
![noun_keycap_board](https://i.imgur.com/FFxttkm.png)
[Not a real design, for conceptualization of single keycap only - by boardbay]

Once manufacturing, assembly, and quality testing are complete, the NFTs can be redeemed. They will be stored with a distributor or manufacturer and can be redeemed at any time. It is possible to sell the NFTs prior to redeeming them. 

### Current Progress
All progress will be made public on our Notion page, where we keep info that is up to date. Here are some highlights from the current progress:
- Talking to two manufacturers and shared general idea to confirm production and timeline feasibility.
- In contact with mentioned designers and discussing collaboration terms.
- Quotes and plans on keycap marketing with various designers.
- Registered [Nouns.mk](http://Nouns.mk), twitter account [@nounsmk](https://twitter.com/nounsmk), [nounsmk.eth](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth%3A0x144975eEc9674fd0Af3d6F3FBa8D660879cE3881) and nounsmkdao.eth.

## Detailed Costs (8-12 month project)

These are the costs with a small margin of error to account for challenges that arise during physical goods manufacturing. But we aim to be efficient and transparent with the budget in our Notion. The ETH is transferred to mechies.eth which has 3/4 threshold including Profish, NextMech, Zaak (from Zora) and Gami.

### Manufacturing - 52 ETH

- Tooling setup for a minimum of 200 units at approx. 400 USD depending on design complexity. Aiming for 1-2k units to reduce unit cost to 300.
- 100-200 keycap sets only for future sale.
- 15% supply buffer for quality control issues (but they will be available for selling when we see that there are no issues with the supply)
- 4 units for prototypes 0.7 ETH each (including shipping)
- Tooling setup for manufacturing (case layout, colours, materials, testing, handling supply chain, etc)
- Post manufacturing processes such as etching, quality checks, and assembling
- Remaining parts such as PCBs, switches, frames, screws, badges, etc.

### Delivery - 10 ETH

- Assembling and Packaging
- Storing in warehouse until shipment
- Shipping with insurance (priority DHL for example) in case of damages or lost property so we can compensate the NFT holder or retry

### Marketing - 21.69 ETH

- Digital assets such as videos, gifs, 3D renders for social media
- Manufacturing cost of physical marketing assets for give away and raffles
    - 100 to 200 super custom keycaps: 3D resin, 2 piece keycaps, handmade interactive keycaps, etc.
    - 400 to 600 Artisan keycaps: basic metallic, infill metallic, plastic, basic resin, CNC etc.
    - 1/1 fully custom keyboard to be auctioned
    - Simple keycaps and NFC chipped keycaps as POAPs for hackathons
    - Novelty keys for the main keycap set
- Marketing units sent to YouTube and twitch influencers for review
- Misc: post manufacturing skins, digital art commission, social media posts, etc.
- Hosting launch event and keyboard meetups 

### Team - 35 ETH

- 16 ETH - Managing the project across manufacturing, marketing, tech, admin, community,  subcontractors, delivery, etc.
- 7 ETH - Website development and tech infrastructure for minting and collecting, open source forks such as Builder DAO and VIA
- 6 ETH - Designer commissions for MK design and manufacturing spec (CAD files)
- 4 ETH - graphics, branding assets and website design 
- 2 ETH - misc fees such as gas, spreads, SAAS services, smart contracts, retro costs etc.

**Total - 118.69 ETH**

## Short Q&A

- **How much is the NFT mint?** Approximately 0.3-0.4 ETH. Nouns holders will receive a discount which brings the price close to cost. We aim to make it affordable by keeping manufacturing reasonable and reduce margin by increasing units. The marketing assets will vary in the form of free, free mint-to-win, at cost, at profit, auctions, free scan to keep and more.
- **How expensive are MKs?** Custom mechanical keyboards by reputable designers can go upwards of 800-1000 USD. Production is constrained due to the tooling overhaul process, which makes the product rare. Also, NFT feature on top add to that value as we experiment with VIA.
- **How does the redemption work?** Sharing pictures of MKs online is important, and having an NFT to share is even better. Once you redeem, the NFT becomes non-transferable. Also, it allows for over the air updates through the VIA software for lighting, macros, sounds, etc.
- **Will the keyboards be assembled?** It is common for the manufacturer to send unassembled keyboards. Assembly is quite easy, as all the components are plug-ins, so if they don't assemble it, we will either work with a distributor or assemble them ourselves. We are even considering an option where the NFT holder can chose between these two options, since the assembling process is part of the experience. However, it's too early to tell if that will be possible.
- **How long does it take to deliver?** Usually around 10-12 months from the proposal passing to delivery. Keycap sets can sometimes take up to 3 years to deliver, but we are going to make sure that doesn't happen. Also, we think we can shorten this time for future iterations in the MK DAO.
- **How big is the MK community?** You'd be surprised who likes MK since it doesn't come up in conversation. The forums and Discord servers of designers are similar to or, bigger in size and activity compared to crypto communities. Although, it is pretty scattered online, but I have made a [spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing) to provide some context.
- **Will there be a sub DAO?** We aim to start one, since there is so much you can do as a community. For example, new keycap styles come out every year, so the DAO can continue commissioning collabs with any theme. We will airdrop supporters, including Nouns to join the MK DAO.

267,Explorer Grants,"# Explorer Grants



**TL;DR**
Explorer Grants is coming off a successful pilot, finding and funding five great people. We learned a lot of what worked, and what didn’t. We are asking to be trusted with more capital to bring more talented builders into the Nouns ecosystem.

We would like to run two more rounds of grants, as well as invest further in the project to attract more talented builders to the Nouns ecosystem through Explorer Grants.


## Pilot Round Recap

![](https://i.imgur.com/RMqi2Xs.jpg)
 

_What our Explorers have done:_


* [Greg](https://twitter.com/gregskril) - built Prop 249 (Solo Staking), built the Nouns API, and NounsList
* [Drew](https://twitter.com/drewcoffman) - created valuable content about Nouns, crafted a thoughtful video and TikToks, gained Nouns delegation from Wilson and has been voting with reason consistently.
* [Jackson](https://twitter.com/jackson_felty) - created cookbook.dev/nouns, running a workshop on how to build on Nouns
* [Tigris](https://twitter.com/tigrisli) - built many, many, prototypes, wrapping up a proposal for Nouns hardware going on-chain after this!
* Our fifth explorer had to put the grant on pause due to unforeseen work coming up. We are hopeful we can restart their grant or use it for someone else in the second pilot round.

What we learned:



- Grants are an excellent marketing tool for the DAO; by leaning into the funds that we were given, we were able to beat the record of applicants to a Nouns Prop House Round (90) and build a sizable following outside of Nouns, despite no previous traction. **_Therefore, every $ of the grants was used for two purposes: marketing the grant and the actual grant._** If the grants were smaller, we would have gotten less applicants.
- There are amazing people waiting to be Nouns-pilled who just need a bit of help. Just in our first round, we had to reject amazing applicants who could have contributed great things to Nouns and just needed a bit of help. 
- We probably won’t get people to leave their jobs with large Explorer Grants (some of you can say _“I told you so!”_ here). We got few applicants with full-time jobs, and participants who were not tied down to other responsibilities were often able to go deeper on Nouns. ***We want to give alternative, smaller Explorer Grants to talented builders who have other commitments, paired with hands-on support.***
- Bringing people into Nouns takes time and effort - a lot of the people we talked to weren’t available at the moment, and ***building connections with prospective explorers takes time.*** This is similar to executive headhunting - not as straightforward as finding someone and giving them money.
- ***Hack Week*** was a lot of fun and a great success with 90 ETH deployed, hundreds of participants, and dozens of new contributors to our community!

## Goals for this round

***Our #1 priority is to continue bringing top talent into Nouns.***  We want to fund 5x as many builders while maintaining the quality of the Pilot Round - we have an ongoing list of people who were highly interested but unavailable during our original application period. We’ll continue our main grants by doing two cycles of 6 grants of 6 ETH each. We may also use Prop House’s infinite rounds to run part of our smaller Explorer Grants, which Nouners will be voting on. 

Other objectives:



- **Re-invest into the EG talent pipeline:** build out a community, build out a strong decentralized brand for Explorer Grants, and create content that brings in more talent from outside of Nouns. This will require paying people outside of the main team.
- **Contribute to the Nouns dev ecosystem:** we ran Nouns Hack Week and would like to continue efforts like it, build out content for Nouns builders as a whole, and be stewards of Nouns contributors. 
- **Participate in governance:** we’d like 1 Noun to support Explorers and Builders (we are currently paying for delegation). This also doubles as an equity-like payment to the Explorer Grants team so that we can share in the upside of Nouns. None of us own Nouns.

### Ask
* Grants: 100 ETH
    * Regular (via application cycles): 12 x 6 = 72 ETH
    * Small (via Infinite Rounds + by team): 14 x 2 ETH = 28 ETH

268,Nouns Autobidder Trial (by Federation),"# Nouns Autobidder Trial (by Federation)

![auctionbidder.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FzfRFjyD/auctionbidder.png)

## TLDR

This proposal deploys a Federation AutoBidder to purchase Nouns at auction for use in future proposals. 

The AutoBidder will be funded with 31 ETH, which will allow the community to trial the AutoBidder with minimal risk and acquire 1 Noun for the treasury.

## AutoBidder

AutoBidder is a contract for trustlessly bidding on Nouns at auction. It can be configured with settings that define how it can bid: MinBid, MaxBid, Tip, BidWindow, and the recipient of Nouns won.  Once configured, anyone can submit a transaction to force the contract to bid. Calling `bid()` refunds gas and rewards the caller with a small tip, ensuring the AutoBidder consistently runs.

This Nouns AutoBidder will be deployed with the following settings: 

- MinBid: `30 ETH` 
- MaxBid: `30 ETH`
- BidWindow: `24 hours`
- Tip: `0.001 ETH` (tip is an incentive for anyone to kick off a bid)
- Receiver: `0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10` (treasury)
- Contract Balance: `31 ETH`

These settings will allow the AutoBidder to place a bid of 30 ETH whenever a new
auction starts until funds are exhausted or the contract is paused.

More info can be found on how the AutoBidder works here: [Github Repository](https://github.com/nounish/autobidder)

## 👨‍🚀 Introduction

Lil Bubble is an established Web3-native character who has been releasing satirical songs and music videos for the community since 2019. His songs and remixes put a tongue-in-cheek spin on market events and have clocked **OVER 10 MILLION VIEWS**, adding to the cultural fabric of the space with a comedic blend of music, video and niche subject matter.

[![](https://i.imgur.com/5EwyJEF.jpg)](https://twitter.com/TheCryptoBubble/status/1587404329262030849)

His engaged crypto-centric audience and alignment with Nounish values (using creative remixes and finely-crafted memes to contribute to Web3 culture) make Lil Bubble a great asset to Nouns. He has been a strong supporter and participant in the Nouns community - has featured Nouns in a previous music video, was one of the earliest members and supporters of Gnars DAO, has been a special guest in a number of Noun Square Twitter spaces, and is currently working on his own Nouns fork.

## ⭐️ Previous Nounish Work

Lil Bubble featured Noun 189 and owner [Gami](https://gami.wtf) in a music video in August last year. A custom Noun skateboard was featured in the video which was shared widely throughout the community garnering over 370k impressions and 145k video views on Twitter alone.

## 📝 Artist Remarks

As one of the first members of Gnars DAO it was fun to finally make some music for my favourite crew! There were a few elements to incorporate into the EP - Gnarly skate references, up-beat Nounish vibes, 8bit sound design, and Lil Bubble's signature crypto moonboy motif. I wanted each song to be a different style to keep things interesting. 

### Never Gonna Grow Up

[![](https://i.imgur.com/iz4QGdx.jpg)](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/never-gonna-grow-up/s-tNxMPjzxvJN)

This is my interpretation of Gnars (and by extension Nouns). Skateboarding played a big role in my childhood so being able to re-ignite that passion with Gnars sparks all kinds of youthful nostalgia. Connecting with a new group of people in adulthood and engaging, building and creating together in new ways gives me that same feeling. I'm never gonna grow up!

### Blast Off 

[![](https://i.imgur.com/6sM9fSe.jpg)](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/blast-off/s-gIVZEDQB0wY)

This is probably my favourite instrumental on the EP. The trap beat and super simple 8bit-inspired synths are very 'Lil Bubble' and a pretty good glimpse at the direction I'm taking things with my original music moving forward. Lots of Gnars references in the lyrics!

### Level Up

[![](https://i.imgur.com/biGY1Ck.jpg)](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/level-up/s-rnUMscL3a6K)

I wanted to step the energy up in the final track, moving in a slightly more tribal direction (Gnars is about extreme sports after all). More skate references in the lyrics - spot the shoutout to celebrity Gnars DAO member Bob Burnquist! I tied things together with plenty of digital glitches and some classic Lil Bubble trader stories. Regardless of which Web3 camp you sit in, you would have no doubt grown familiar with the market cycles and how they affect us all in one way or another. Trading aside, we should always be trying to level up and improve some area of our lives. Like my kickflips...

## **1. TL;DR**

We would like to seek funding of 192.4K USDC *(~99 ETH)* to keep maintaining & developing [archives.wtf](https://archives.wtf/) as the main archive center of Nouns DAO over the next 6 months (May '23-Oct '23). Our focus is to increase the current media contents of Nouns ecosystem with the support of software improvements & public goods tools together enhancing user experiences.

    * nounish artworks from contests, events
    * cc0 contents & working files
* It is difficult for new people to discover any nounish contents because it is dispersed everywhere, throughout Twitter, Instagram & other platforms unless they have their own website or media-oriented approach which uses apps like Youtube. Particularly from the perspective of those who do not fully comprehend the Nouns ecosystem and where they might find it.
* There is no specific rule for proposers to update their project progress everyday, fortnightly, or once a month but we could encourage people to do that more often if we help to provide the right tools.
* Some builders with huge outcomes but stucked with time constraint need an additional support to archive their outputs.

As a central resource platform, cross pollination is one of things needed. Some of the early builders require assistance with visibility. With the connected links that point people to each nounish projects and builders, we assist the public in finding them.

### **The Strategies**

![](https://i.imgur.com/EKvVcFO.png)

**Strategy 1 ; Curated submission form**

* We want to build **a curated submission form** attached to the website which benefits from multiple touchpoints.
* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) and could request to submit a new sub-category and additional contents to their existing proposals/details.
* The forms will allow users to select their preferred category, status, type of house, round, etc. *(based on specific usage)*
* User can check their submission history together with submission details *(eg; date, title & status)*

![](https://i.imgur.com/gVzs6Ih.png)

**Strategy 2 ; Uploader**

* We want to improvise an [uploader](https://uploadr.app/) with some new features which we have built for the past few months.
* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) & it will be token gated focusing on Nouns ecosystem to use it for free ;
    * Nounders
    * Nouners
    * Nounish Builders
    * Sub DAOs
    * Nouns' NFT Open Edition Holders / Droposals *(This Is Nouns, The Wizard's Hat etc)*
* Anyone who has just got noun-pilled into the ecosystem and want to use it, they may choose from any of the available criteria above. This will gradually benefit the Nouns DAO ecosystem over time.
* User can check their upload history together with the details *(eg; date, title & arweave link)*
* The fee of the uploaded permanent data is included under **OpEx** in ***Budget***.

![](https://i.imgur.com/IoUQQkb.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/KFIzROZ.png)

---

**Strategy 3 ; Tooling R&D**

* We want to create and launch tooling research and development that will bring significant effect on the process and project's efficiency and for the DAO where everyone could benefit from it.
* We will use the fund under **OpEx** in ***Budget***.

**The strategies mentioned are what we are focused on so far, but they are subject to change along the way or the best recommendations from the community. There will be more along the journey.*

### **Data Permanence**

* We are using **Arweave** network to store all the datas due to its one time fee permanent storage and we want to use it exclusively for all storage going forward.
* Currently, around **40%** of the datas are now saved on Arweave, with the remaining **60%** being processed. *(Currently on Notion)*
* There have been a few instances where artists or builders have discontinued their hosting and lost their tracks; this is something we do not want to happen again.
* We want to make sure all datas of Nouns ecosystem are permanently stored in a decentralised manner and is always accessible.
* We are able to boost the website's performance with the help of **Vercel Edge Network** which offers image optimization, page load speed & automatically data cached on the network.
* The cost of uploading will be factor in under **OpEx** as per attached in ***Budget***.
* Publish monthly data report of [archives.wtf ](https://archives.wtf/) for public reference.
* All compiled datas are stored in [Nouns Archive's notion](https://voadz.notion.site/Nouns-Archive-da52f93301dd4ed59e5b876bd5151d93).

### **RSS Feed**

Utilising a simplified and condensed data feed can be more efficient than navigating through an entire website for the required information, making data feed crucial for individual use cases. That is why we're adding feed as a new feature, to make it easier for you to access the data you need and achieve your goals more efficiently.

We will provide a few types of feed for the main & sub-category pages ;
  * RSS feed - /rss.xml
  * Atom  feed - /atom.xml
  * JSON feed - /feed.json

The data we have gathered can be utilised by everyone in the ecosystem for their own unique purposes. For instance, a mini companion app can directly use the JSON feed to list all proposals in NSFW Small Grants.

### **Analytics**

We believe data transparency is important for the DAO & community. We are using **Vercel's Web Analytics** to get detailed insights. It provides in-depth information about your website's visitors, new metrics like top pages, top referrers, and demographics including information on countries, operating systems, and browsers.

As of *29th March - 20th April 2023,*

* Visitors & Page Views

### **Sustainability Strategy**

The main intention of this project is to provide long-term benefits for Nouns. It serves as main archive center that provides wide media contents all over Nouns ecosystem for public reference. Once the open-source repository is public, we will be able to observe other NFT communities with active builders & projects and who benefits from Nouns' product to use it such as ;

**Possible Candidates**
* Nouns' extension & derivatives
* Meebits
* On-Chain Monkey
* UMA
* TinyDinos
* Anata

### **What's next?**

We certainly have long-term goals with few phases as we wish to accomplish them gradually. We attempt to avoid by highlighting all of our future objectives in one specific proposal as it sounds overly ambitious as we aim to underpromise and over-deliver. We believe that this will provide long term values and benefits to the DAO. It may not be a direct ROI.

Some ideas worth looking at ;
1. Preservation of archive material ( physical & digital )
2. Nouns Archive '23 ( Limited physical edition )
3. Publications - zines/quarterly
4. Archive Data Request
5. Ticketed exhibition of Nouns Archive materials ( ROI to DAO )

271,“The Nominal Hero”: A Nouns Middle Grade Novel,"# “The Nominal Hero”: A Nouns Middle Grade Novel

TL;DR: I’m writing a middle-grade novel called “The Nominal Hero.”

Caden Keller, age eight, is an imaginative boy who loves words and reading. One day, he gets hold of a pair of glasses that let him call up Nouns, who are more than happy to use their Nounish powers to bring chaos and adventure into his life. But when a few careless words summon a threat to the Nouniverse, can Caden use the power of language to save the world?

ABOUT THE BOOK: The general vibe is Beverly Cleary’s “Ramona” series meets Norton Juster’s “The Phantom Tollbooth.” I’m aiming it at six-to-ten-year-olds, and it’ll be fairly light-hearted: no tragedies, no dead pets, just adventures as the strange and surreal world of the Nouniverse intersects with the everyday home and school life of Caden and his friends and family.

I want this to be a book that kids will enjoy reading on their own and that adults will also have fun reading to them. I’m running it by my favourite eight-year-old as I go, to make sure that the vocabulary level is appropriate and that the whole thing is fun and entertaining to a bright kid.

I’m linking the first two chapters here, as text and as an audio file of me reading them aloud. I’ve got five chapters written so far, out of a planned twelve, and I have a clear outline of how the story will proceed. I expect to release an additional chapter about every three weeks, which I’ll be posting at http://rookswater.blogspot.com. When the whole thing is out, I’ll do some final edits and put together the definitive edition in ebook form. At that time, I’ll post a separate proposal for launching the ebook as a timed open edition mint event.

Audio:
https://youtu.be/_-usP1Qe78c

Chapter 1:
https://rookswater.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-nominal-hero-ch-1.html

Chapter 2:
https://rookswater.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-nominal-hero-ch-2.html

THE ASK: I’m requesting 25 ETH. This is for two things. First, to cover my living expenses for the next six months to let me focus on finishing the book. Second, I will be placing the book in the public domain immediately; this means that, unlike with a traditionally published book, I won’t be able to sell things like foreign-language rights, reprint rights, film option rights, and so forth. So this is partly to compensate for the lack of those future revenue streams, which normally provide traditionally published authors with a significant part of our ongoing income.

I’d like to stream this amount over the course of six months. I’ve put up the first two chapters here, I’ll post the third right away on acceptance of this proposal, and then I’ll be posting a new chapter every three weeks, so in just about six months the whole book will be available. I’ll provide the final edited book in .epub and .pdf formats no more than one month after the last chapter is posted.

ABOUT TASHA K. ROOKSWATER: Under another name, I’m an author of science fiction and fantasy, primarily short stories and novellas. I’m enjoying the freedom of writing something completely different under this pseudonym. 

I’m a newcomer to crypto, but I’m fascinated by the artistic potential of this space. I love the public-domain aspect of Nouns and I’m looking forward to other people building on Caden’s story. I’m a big believer in fanfiction and the collaborative nature of storytelling, and I’m excited to send this book out into the world and see what comes back.

Proposer notes:
 
Tasha is a published science fiction author and IRL associate that I introduced to Nouns. I encouraged her to write this proposal because I think she's talented and that our ecosystem will benefit from the participation of more storytellers. Please feel free to follow up with any questions on Twitter: @rookswater and @punk4156.

**TL;DR⌐◨-◨: UnitedTribes & @jdagogo bring WarpedWorld to Nouns, the web3 reimagining of the biggest and longest-running music, sports, and cultural touring festival, Warped Tour. WarpedWorld is a collaboration of the original Warped partners/founders and Creative Artists Agency (CAA).**

**Together, NounsDAO and WarpedWorld will create a newly empowered world and community where entire industries like music and entertainment are reimagined through the use of NFT technology.**


**This proposal launches a partnership growth strategy during which @jdagogo will focus exclusively on executing initiatives within the Nouns ecosystem.**

# **A Radical Re-Invention ⌐◨-◨**

The initial focus of this proposal is WarpedWorld, the web3 reimagining of the Warped Tour festival and community. The festival was founded over 25 years ago by J.D. and his collaborators.

Additionally, this proposal aims to refine the playbook for onboarding established communities into the Nouns ecosystem and web3, empowered through a Nounish development hub, and including the introduction of **WarpedDAO.** 

Introducing Nouns to millions of people and empowering communities to join Nouns will achieve a high ROI on this initiative.


Throughout this prop, UnitedTribes led by [@jdagogo](https://twitter.com/jdagogo) [(J.D. Heilprin)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdheilprin) will use the same approach he's used as an entrepreneur and Entrepreneur/Evangelist in Residence to generate a variety of projects, outlined below. The main focus is onboarding new communities and creating collabrative partnership opportunities for NounsDAO via WarpedWorld. 

WarpedWorld will kick-off with a series of IRL activations involving and proliferating the NounsDAO community. The initial term will lay the foundation for a long-term Nounish collaboration. 

**In the first 6 months, J.D. will bring his WarpedWorld project and partners to the Nouns ecosystem, and a series of proposals will be introduced to the NounsDAO.**

# Nouns Industry Evangelist & Ambassador ⌐◨-◨

**J.D. & UnitedTribes’ other web3 Projects + Nouns**

J.D. will introduce his other existing projects to the Nouns ecosystem as proposals, utilizing the Noun infrastructure to proliferate the Nouns meme and community while activating new audiences.  

Example projects include collaborating with an acclaimed dance cinematographer and a top dance company to support pro and amateur dancers worldwide, as well as a concept celebrating music scholarship with top-tier artists. Both projects focus on generating Nounish benefits while fostering community.

**Digging Deep into J.D.’s Network & EIR experience**

As both an entrepreneur and EIR, J.D. will draw on his experience to bring additional projects and communities to the Nouns ecosystem. For example, inspired by the recent “Wizard’s Hat” short film and Wizard Nouns, J.D. has already introduced the concept of a potential Nouns collaboration with the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Warner Bros., and the Potter fan community. At Warner Bros., J.D. worked extensively with Wizarding World.

![](https://i.imgur.com/yBceGEt.png)

Additional opportunities will involve working with existing IP holders, creative, tech, and performative talent, and the institutions across J.D.’s network. 

J.D. will serve as a Nouns educator, evangelist, and facilitator in both his network and the traditional media, entertainment, and marketing industries. He will introduce talent, venture capitalists, builders, developers, creatives, and prospective strategic partners to the Nouns ecosystem and opportunities for Nounish endeavors. J.D. will collaborate with NounsOTG and other initiatives to make introductions and leverage resources. Over the last two months, J.D. has tested the waters to a tremendous response. 

**Lending a Strategic Hand Across the Nouniverse**

J.D. will partner with established Nouns projects to generate synergies among UnitedTribes initiatives and assist Noun projects needing access to talent and organizations throughout his network.

* **IRL Events.** The first Warped proposal will involve producing a series of events to educate the Warped community about web3, WarpedWorld plans, and Nouns. The strategy is to seed the community onboarding process by providing exclusive limited edition NFTs, POAPs, and other incentives while introducing the community to relevant Nouns-related activities and organizations. 


**Phase 2:**
* **WarpedDAO** The core economic engine of WarpedWorld and intended to fund community projects and proposals to benefit and jumpstart the WarpedWorld ecosystem. 
* **WarpedWorld Membership Program** - token-gated fan-based participation platform with IRL and Virtual benefits - the objective is onboarding the massive Warped fan community, introducing web3 loyalty and community ownership.
* **WarpedWorld Creator Toolkit** - A best-of-breed web3 composable toolkit that enables and onboards the thousands of creators and their teams in the Warped community. 
* **Activations - Virtual and IRL Across WarpedWorld** - an ever-expanding community of events and activities that serves as a model for fully developed web3 communities. 

# **Action Items ⌐◨-◨**

**First 60-Day Period:** 

* **Nouns Get Warped Grassroots Awareness Campaign:** J.D. will collaborate across the Nouns community to propose a series of IRL events designed to both introduce and proliferate Nouns to the Warped community and educate the Warped community about Nouns, Web3, and WarpedWorld.
    *  Events will involve Nouns, Warped artists and/or athletes, Warped Partners and CAA, Vans (potentially at Vans retail), Warped and Nounish Causes, and web3 educational resources. 
*  J.D. will seek the participation of any and all Nouns-related entities, including Gnars & thatsgnar.ly; ComicsDAO, Nouns OTG, Nouns Esports, and other Nouns groups as appropriate.
* Warped Phase-1 will serve as a run-up and planning for Warped Phase-2, working with the Nouns community to spec and plan for the anticipated WarpedDAO (or “WarpedNouns” name tbd), a creator DAO built in conjunction with the Nouns community that utilizes the Noun’ tech stack. (See below add’l detail on WarpedWorld phases).

**Second 60-Day Period:**

* Begin planning for WarpedWorld Phase-2
* Introduce Dancing Nouns and/or Musical Nouns, or such other Nounish projects that follow the model established by Gnars and thatsgnar.ly, proliferating Nouns and extending Nounish good to new communities.
* Explore and present other projects including potential Creative Commons collaboration. 
* Introduction of Nouns to new creator communities, brands, and opportunities. 


**Third 60-Day Period:**
* WarpedWorld Phase-1 IRL activations begin;
* Introduce additional project proposals for Dancing Nouns and/or Musical Nouns.
* Continued outreach, including exploring Wizarding World Fan Community / Warner Bros and additional creator network onboarding and projects.
* Continued outreach to creator communities, brands, and opportunities.

## Nouns Community Discord & Onboarding

Proposal for 6 months of funding to commit time to transform the Jungle & more.

With the closure of official Nouns DAO Discord, I created the Jungle to be a neutral, spiritual successor to the old discord as a place for Nouners to connect with one another, discuss proposals, and engage with the larger Nouns community. Unfortunately the time of this transition was a low point for the community; there was confusion/sadness/drama surrounding the discord closure, Nouns auction prices were down, the overall market was down, and vibes were down in general. Some of this carried over into the Jungle at it’s inception, leading to some negative first impressions and lasting impacting on discord’s culture/perception at a time when it was most important.

I am planning to rebrand the Jungle into a general Nouns DAO Community discord and engaging other community leaders in hopes of capturing the same spirit and camaraderie we had with the initial Nouns DAO discord.

I am requesting funding to ensure the necessary time and effort goes into maximizing the value that this discord can provide to the Nouns community, in addition other nounish contributions I want to focus on over the coming months.

[![Nouns Community Discord](https://i.imgur.com/4S1HO1t.png)](https://discord.gg/T5K7U6DM)

## Currently
The Jungle hosts weekly calls for Nouners & Delegates to discuss on-chain proposals, neutrally leading the group through pending proposals while allowing the public to listen in and hear how voters are weigh in on pending props. These calls initially followed the format of discord’s weekly private calls, however the calls have recently shifted to be public  with a Q&A component where Proposers are encouraged to join the call & answer questions and provide extra context/clarity to their props.

In addition, chat channels are maintained for each on-chain proposal to allow for async conversations between Nouners/Delegates, Builders, and the larger Nouns community


[![Nouns Community Discord](https://i.imgur.com/F1O7wkC.png)](https://discord.gg/T5K7U6DM)


## Opportunities
I want to transform the Jungle into the premiere place for onboarding new Nouners, not only to the Nouns Community Discord itself but by providing credibly neutral, up-to-date information around on-chain proposals and the highest impact communities, initiatives, and activations happening across the Nouns ecosystem. 
*	Implement automated processes for new members joining the Discord, providing up-to-date links and resources
*	Create onboarding documentation for new DAO members, working with the community to compile and maintain high-value resources/links/information all in one place
*	Leverage Discord’s Forum feature to create posts for every past on-chain proposal to provide a one stop shop for async discussion for anything that is, or has ever been on-chain.

[![Nouns Community Discord](https://i.imgur.com/nZmjLlL.png)](https://discord.gg/T5K7U6DM)

## Roles & Responsibilities

275,Treasury Diversification: Swap 400 wstETH -> rETH via TWAMM,"# Treasury Diversification: Swap 400 wstETH -> rETH via TWAMM

## tldr;
Help execute treasury diversification of the [Nouns DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10), specifically `wstETH => rETH`. We have built a tool that’s tailor-made to help execute these trades: *TWAMM.* The trade will be executed completely on-chain, transparently with very low fees and minimal gas costs.

## **Background**
TWAMM is a concept introduced by [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/07/twamm) in July 2021. *""It works by breaking long-term orders into infinitely many infinitely small pieces and executing them against an embedded constant-product AMM smoothly over time.""*

An on-chain AMM protocol to enable large token swap is essential to increase DeFi adoption and anti-fragility. Some interesting use cases for TWAMMs include [treasury diversification](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1502177286170185735)*,* [whale liquidations](https://twitter.com/solendprotocol/status/1538553654575214592)*,* [peg maintenance](https://www.notion.so/fd88cb37208d4b0f9abaca4e276f9ddd)*, etc*.

## **Product Design & Incentives**
We have been researching and developing TWAMMs since November 2021 and recently launched our protocol: [announcement](https://twitter.com/cronfinance/status/1645802789006876672). The code has been audited by SpearbitDAO, open-sourced, and verified on Etherscan. There’s more detail on the protocol on our [docs page](https://docs.cronfi.com/twamm/).
- AMM: we built our TWAMM as a custom pool on top of Balancer V2 Vaults given the *security, liquidity, flexibility, and gas advantages* of leveraging Balancer. Additionally, Balancer has become a Schelling point for protocols that want to leverage their AMM, thus creating network effects & composability advantages.
- Traders: as a long-term trader (Nouns DAO), you only have to pay gas for starting, canceling, or withdrawing proceeds from your order. All the other sub-orders of the DCA are done virtually and cost the Nouns DAO no gas fees. Virtual orders are only written on-chain when the next user interacts with the protocol (generally an arbitrageur).
- Arbitrageurs: as seen on other AMMs like Uniswap, arbitrageurs are important to keep the price of the assets in line with external venues. Arbitrageurs are critical for TWAMMs because trade sizes are significantly larger and last for multiple blocks. Therefore we partnered with dedicated arbitrageurs (BloXRoute) to ensure pools are frequently arbitraged thus giving you a smooth fill.
- Liquidity: Balancer already has over ***$131M*** in wstETH and ***$62M*** in rETH in the vault. We have successfully received a [liquidity + gauge](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-265-enable-wsteth-reth-gauge-ethereum/4643) to direct some of the liquidity to our TWAMM pool to provide the resting liquidity needed to execute this trade. TWAMMs are extremely capital efficient given that the trades are split across multiple blocks and arbitrageurs consistently bring new liquidity back to the system to correct price deviations.

## **Advantages**
- Low fees: wstETH/rETH is a stable pair and long-term swappers pay a one-time **0.03% fee.**
- Fully on-chain: zero dependencies on off-chain services, oracles, compute etc.
- Flexible: issue, change, and cancel orders with ease.
    - Example new order: `sell 14_000 wstETH for rETH in 100_000 blocks` ~roughly 2 weeks
    - Easy to use Gnosis Safe custom transaction UX
- Full control of orders and assets: non-custodial, cancellable, and withdraw proceeds at any time.
- Withdraw multiple times: users can withdraw once at the end, or every set number of blocks – they just pay gas fees.
- DCA over 1000’s of blocks gas-free: Nouns DAO would only pay gas for starting and ending orders, and arbitrageurs pay for placing suborders on-chain.
- Analytics: we will have an analytics dashboard that shows how the order is being filled so the DAO can monitor the trade.

## **Risks & Mitigations**
The first trade will be for a relatively *small* amount of roughly 400 wstETH -> rETH to ensure TWAMM executes the trade as expected. Below are a few potential risks of the system and how we have and plan to mitigate them:
- Smart contract:
    - Fully audited: see SpearbitDAO report [here](https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/blob/master/pdfs/CronFinance-Spearbit-Security-Review.pdf).
    - Hack Risks: built on Balancer V2 Vaults which have been battle-tested for 2+ years.
    - Bricked Pools: we’ve done extensive research and mitigations for gas, order DDoS, numerical underflows, incorrect TWAMM parameters etc – more info here: [0slippage](https://mirror.xyz/0slippage.eth).
    - Loss of Funds: open-source code, audited, verified, non-custodial, users in full control of funds, trade happens over multiple blocks so it can be canceled at any time by the user.
    - Malicious Pool Admin: all pool administrators can do is pause the pool or change fees at which point Nouns DAO can cancel and withdraw their funds.
- Lack of Arbitrage: we have teamed up with BloXroute to provide dedicated arbitrage service. On the off chance neither service arbitrages the pool, the open market will arbitrage the pool.
- Poor Execution: orders are cancellable at any time i.e if the price escapes preferred bounds restart the order at another time. Also, DCA is generally a better strategy than spot purchase for large orders.
  - Monitoring: we will be actively monitoring the trade as the `delegate` to ensure the order is being filled at an optimal price. In case the trade escapes the optimal threshold, we will cancel the trade on behalf of the DAO and proceeds will be refunded to the Nouns DAO wallet.
- Information Leakage: this is not a big concern for a stable pair like wstETH/rETH which are like assets and have deep liquidity pools.
- MEV/Sandwich Attacks: orders are broken into small pieces and thus the benefit of front/back running orders is minimal – see the Paradigm paper for further details.

## **Competition**

Here are the alternatives and how they stack up against TWAMM. Note this isn’t a comprehensive list, but a short summary.

- Gnosis Auction:
    - Pros: well-tested technology
    - Cons: reliant on well-funded keepers, minimum buy lots, price upside capped, infrastructure overhead, limited timeframe, poor execution vs DCA over long periods.
- Manual DCA:
    - Pros: can execute it today
    - Cons: need to write a smart contract or fat finger mistakes, fees for each sub-order, gas costs of sub-orders, limited # of sub-orders
- DEX/Aggregators:
    - Pros: complete trade in a single block
    - Cons: slippage, MEV attack vectors
- OTC:
    - Pros: limit orders and other novel trade execution algorithms
    - Cons: off-chain, opaque, high fees, custodial, KYC, regulations, etc",CANCELLED,17163230,17199230,1,69,,1000000,1000,2000,690,0,0,0,"['0', '0', '0']","['0xba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c8', '0x7f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca0', '0xe0ca4dac40d44d737f0d02b1f2b2d969731ecda9']","['setRelayerApproval(address,address,bool)', 'approve(address,uint256)', 'longTermSwap(address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256,address)']",17127230,1682473655,0x950f22b82119a7cf8be90bc373a5bacbb0473f0664cabcce7365dfab3103c5a8,"['0x0000000000000000000000000bc3807ec262cb779b38d65b38158acc3bfede10000000000000000000000000e0ca4dac40d44d737f0d02b1f2b2d969731ecda90000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001', '0x000000000000000000000000ba12222222228d8ba445958a75a0704d566bf2c8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000015af1d78b58c400000', '0x0000000000000000000000007f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca0000000000000000000000000ae78736cd615f374d3085123a210448e74fc63930000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000015af1d78b58c40000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002a300000000000000000000000029c5dad7e34d0a27d6f65a0a7e07e4d03dcd68c8']",0x29c5dad7e34d0a27d6f65a0a7e07e4d03dcd68c8

# Nounish Playground - The Game

## TL;DR:
We're proposing to build a mobile platformer game with 700 levels in which we introduce players to nounish concepts and educate them on Nouns DAO and adjacent extensions while playing through fun and engaging maps. While the total budget required to complete the game development is $200,000, we are seeking funding of **$90,000** for the alpha version, which will include an **early access** release. The alpha version is expected to take 6 months to complete, followed by an additional 6 months until the final release. Once the alpha version is released, we will require the remaining budget to complete the development of the game.

## Description

**Click on the image to view the proposed game design.**

[![](https://i.imgur.com/j38RqEz.jpg)
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toY9TC21gyQ)


---
### The game is divided into two parts:
- Single Player
- Multiplayer

### Single Player
The single-player mode is a platformer game.

In this mode the player controls their noun to reach its destination - to be minted and sent to auction at **Nouns DAO**.

There is a unique level for each noun minted, designed with various obstacles and challenges.

We as a nounish family are waiting every day to see what the next noun will look like and how much the winning bid is at the auction for the previous noun, but we don't know anything about each noun’s background story. We don't know what a noun has been through before it gets minted! This concept was the inspiration for this game.

### Getting to know **Nounish culture**

Some stages of the game are designed to indirectly teach players about the Nounish culture and the **NounsDAO** mechanism. Players will be enticed to go through these stages in order to obtain valuable rewards, and in the process, they will come across learning opportunities to grasp these concepts. We believe that direct teaching of these concepts might not be engaging for players, so we aim to make the learning experience more fun and interactive through gameplay.

**Click on the picture below to see the video**👇

[![](https://i.imgur.com/GjT0Tiw.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lclo8l3t_g)

#### Gameplay
The player controls their noun throughout each level in a 3D playground. Nouns can run, jump, grab, climb, dive + more to overcome the obstacles until the final point is reached and the noun goes through the gate to get minted.

There is ether on the path that the player must collect to meet the goal. The goal amount of ether is set based on how much that noun sold for at auction.

After completing each level, the player is awarded three stars. The first star is just for completing the level and the second one is awarded if the count of collected ether has reached the winning bid amount and the last star is awarded based on the time spent completing the level.

![](https://i.imgur.com/wgcyHFh.gif)


For example: The first level is about Noun 1 being minted and the player will have to guide the noun through the course while collecting enough ether to meet the winning bid on that noun, while trying to do it in the fastest time possible.

[![](https://i.imgur.com/06KwPXg.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YxpdSb2iYo)

### Multiplayer
In this mode of the game, players enter a battle royal like Fall Guys and compete with one another.

Each session starts with 40 players and three matches are held in each session. At the end of each match, only half of the players walk it through, then at the end of the third match, the final player wins the match.

The game and environment design is nounish and each level/match has its own unique theme based on nounish extensions such as lil nouns, Gnars DAO, Alps DAO, and many others where spectators are members of these communities.

In multiplayer mode, we’ll hold monthly in-game events relevant to DAO news, events, and popular holidays.

![](https://i.imgur.com/h41ZJ6O.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/UkWHRQ5.png)
We aim to differentiate our game from competitors by improving the user experience and providing creative ideas, attractive maps, and Nouns that engage players in exciting challenges. Ultimately, our focus is on delivering a flawless and engaging game experience, and continuously improving it to create a supportive and enjoyable experience for players.
![](https://i.imgur.com/aaNzoDt.png)
After the full release of the game, we plan to hold various competitions, ranging from seasonal events to in-game events and those related to important events in the NounsDAO community. By offering special Nouns-related prizes, our goal is to create more challenges for players and familiarize them with DAOs and NFTs. Additionally, we can hold custom events upon the request of NounsDAO.
![](https://i.imgur.com/r4In8Ph.png)
We aim to reach **25,000** downloads in the first month after the game's release, and strive to achieve a steady growth rate of **5%** in monthly downloads. We intend to encourage players to engage in the single-player mode and invite their friends to play the multiplayer mode.
![](https://i.imgur.com/JV5rG3L.png)
We incentivize players to invite their friends to play the game by offering rewards. Additionally, we create private clones for players to have a space to discuss the game.

## Why a Mobile Game?
Mobile games are easily available to everyone with a smartphone these days and have a wide audience range.

## WHY?
The *__Noggles LED Keychain__* circuit video blew up on Twitter with lots of excitement! This is an opportunity to create a low-cost, yet highly sought after and unique piece of hardware that fits in your pocket and carried daily with you. From conversation starters in person to unboxings and showing off on social media, this device is sleek, a standout, and an instant proliferator.

[![NOUNS-PROP-GIF.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/d3NKdZM3/NOUNS-PROP-GIF.gif)](https://postimg.cc/y3R5Cd8C)

My speciality is creating exceptional and memorable digital and physical experiences through a variety of mediums (i.e. installations, hardware, web, 3D, etc.) working with notable brands such as my ongoing partnerships with Arduino; building conceptual prototypes, fashion brands such as Christopher Kane and Selfridges, and most recently, creating an [exclusive audio-reactive hardware for Zora](https://twitter.com/____zine____/status/1651233581723779078?s=20) (under [Lychee, Inc](https://lychee.vision/) - company I cofounded).

With 58k followers across my socials where 90% are avid hardware enthusiasts, there’s an exciting opportunity to introduce and build a new branch of applicability to Nouns via the Noggles LED hardware device and its CC0 files, giving them a new tool to develop firmware, create physical nounish projects and iterate further.

Explorer Grants has led me here and I think there’s a lot more that Nouns and I can do together to create beautiful nounish objects, art pieces, experiences and more! Having a shared vision to build in the public domain; to open source for more creativity, collaboration and innovation – I think by embracing Nouns and my unique pov as an artist, we can produce captivating nounish creations that showcase the best of both our perspectives and amplify our collective creativity. To leave not only lasting impressions, but the foundational blocks to build upon further and allow other people’s creativity to flourish!

## Proposal

I was first funded by Explorer Grants ([prop 178](https://nouns.wtf/vote/178)) and took the opportunity to create 6 experimental hardware pieces: [a Nouns Governance Wallet](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1631322679172112384?s=20), [USB E-Ink Displaying Daily Nouns & Props](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1625883686561275905?s=20), [Etch-A-Sketch](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1624120919152001040?s=20), [Noggles LED Keychain](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1645788540499025920?s=20), [Noggles Speakers](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1637133435549495297?s=20), and the [Nouns Camera](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1646167941178703872?s=20).

One of these objects stood apart from the rest and got a lot of attention on Twitter. The desire to own a unique Noggles LED Keychain led me directly to create this proposal.

Nouns has the opportunity to lead the way in creating unique hardware-based artwork that many people want to own; setting new standards for innovation and creativity, that aren’t only visually stunning by highly coveted by collectors and enthusiasts alike.

With my strong social presence and commitment to open-source content, I believe I can help reinforce the Nouns brand beyond crypto. Directly through my own brand; in addition of building conceptual hardware and art installations I document videos of those builds that reach over 58,000 followers and have amassed a combined total of +10.7 million video views with a 39.9% engagement rate.

**Why the Noggles LED Keychain?**

- Daily-carry item, it’s an effective means of promoting Nouns and serves as an important signifier and physical representation of the Nouns identity. Its power is in its subtle daily constant that’s unavoidably carried everywhere - making it a strong means of connecting people with the Nouns community.
- *Daily signifier → instant proliferator*
- Affordability → low costs
    - Estimated purchase price: ~$50 (0.025Ξ)

**Hardware Specs:**
- Array of 78 RGB LEDs
- Customized pattern animations (firmware)
- Button to alternate between the patterns
- Rechargeable lithium battery via USB-C

# Who **For?**
I have a high niche community of hardware enthusiasts (Instagram + TikTok) and people in Crypto (Twitter) – I think these Noggle LED Keychains will perfectly hit both demographics, especially as it will all be open-source.

- **Nouners + Nouns Community**
    - this is an artisanal nounish object, a beautifully designed novelty item
    - a tangible semiotic Nouns device that you can carry with you daily and fits in the palm of one’s hand
    - direct symbol and “show” of being part of the Nouns community
- **Hardware Enthusiasts**
    - Typical RGB LED add-ons for Arduino / Raspberry Pi can cost upwards of $50, but the Noggles LED Keychain offers an affordable alternative with a programmable ATTINY85 chip and x78 compact RGB LEDs
    - Designed with CC0 and for hacking / tinkering, Noggles LEDs provide hardware enthusiasts the opportunity to evolve the code and proliferate Nouns by applying it to their own projects, including larger hardware projects such as IoT and the application of sensors.
        - new applicability of Nouns → developing nounish firmware
    - Show hardware enthusiasts and DIY electronics builders that they can build with Nouns, embody the brand’s identity and fuel their own creativity, *with Nouns*
    - Hardware builders and creative engineers are well-positioned to explore exciting possibilities of crypto, but haven’t been shown ways of getting involved. I think with the Noggles LED Keychain (and other Nounish hardware) we can bridge this gap and show them what’s possible!
    - ******3D Printing Enthusiasts / Product Designers (sub-group typically part of hardware builders)******
        - CC0 enclosure files enables engineers and designers to create their own unique versions of the Noggles enclosure with a variety of materials and customizing it to their liking
        - This opens up new opportunities for creative evolution, allowing engineers to physically make their own nounish objects and explore new design possibilities

The proposal includes the development to build, design and prototype the ***Noggles LED Keychain*** with a production run of 600 units- working with manufacturers and liaising with suppliers to meet industry standards and construct the PCB circuit from scratch, complete with a custom software and firmware that will be open-sourced, and a designed enclosure with custom packaging - all to go into production with a custom website for purchasing.

To bring the **Noggles LED Keychain** to market, the project will be divided into 6 stages over a 6 month period, with a total cost of 75Ξ to cover production, design costs, prototyping iterations, hardware components, material costs, material sourcing, labour, etc.

## **An overview of the steps to build the Noggles LED Keychain**

1. **PCB Circuit Design**: This involves R&D for components, block diagrams, MCUs, preliminary design, schematic design, and PCB layout design. I'll also create multiple prototypes for testing
    - Already in progress, currently on Prototype–V2, will need to iterate and adjust minor circuit design + components; at least 1-3 more prototypes to reach finalized design
2. **Software / Firmware**: This includes coding the firmware to run the circuit, integrating the firmware with the hardware, and testing and debugging the product
    - 90% complete - tweaking and evolving design patterns
3. **Enclosure Design**: Create mockup sketches, conduct research and ideation, develop 3D models and CAD designs, and source materials and manufacturers for the enclosure. We'll also create and test three prototypes
    - Resin based material → variety of colours
    - Engraved text → will discuss with Nouners to ensure it accurately reflects the DAO and your values
        [![Nouns-Case.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/Ls8wk6TZ/Nouns-Case.gif)](https://postimg.cc/yD2LsK2V)
        
    - Need to prototype, finish CAD design, create moulds and experiment with resin material and colours
        - Will be handmade by me <3
4. **Manufacturers**: Liaise with suppliers and vendors to source the necessary components
5. **Packaging**: Design, prototype, and source packaging materials for the product.
    - *Very* Early-Stage Packaging Concepts / Mockups (design will evolve with further development and ideation) → thinking about unconventional packaging and a unique experience that accurately reflects Nouns
        - Nouns Tin Can Packaging
            - I want to challenge traditional packaging designs, especially to fit Nouns → make the packaging compelling in of itself and unexpected but embodying the playful and nuanced identity of Nouns
                
               [![Nouns-Packaging-two.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/6pYCZ9qS/Nouns-Packaging-two.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/nX9sbfvY)
                
6. **Website** – an Overview of Purchase Strategy (Crypto and Non-Crypto natives)
    - Access open-source files, code, schematics + guides to “hack / tinker” with the Nouns LED Keychain to create custom pattern colours → CC0
    - To purchase a Nounish Hardware
        - **Pay with Crypto** → crypto consumers → also obtain NFT
        - **Pay with Card** → non-crypto natives → proliferating meme / Noun
            - mainly thinking about my main audience on TikTok / Reels are not crypto-based but hardware enthusiasts and creative technologists / engineers
    
    - **Mockup Designs**(initial ideas → 3 different concepts; to be developed further):

## Allocate Supply to the DAO (50 units) + Profit to the DAO (100%)
I’m very grateful for the opportunity and support the past few months as I’ve been exploring Nouns, as a thank you I’d like to **supply 50 units of the Noggles LED Keychain** as NFTs which can be redeemable at a later time.

I’m most keen and excited about getting this hardware to as many hands as possible and proliferate Nouns in a new tangible format, which I wouldn’t be able to do at such a scale without the support of Nouns. 

So simply being paid for my time to build, experiment and co-create with Nouns is massively rewarding! With that, I’d like for the DAO to have a return on this project so **100% profit / mint revenue will go to the DAO** and my hopes are to continue developing a series of Nounish Hardware and pieces after the completion of this first prop.

- In addition to this, 50 units will be raffled / gifted for marketing purposes
- 500 units in circulation for purchase for 0.025ETH

We are proposing
1. Nouns DAO attempt to claim the top spot on the leaderboard by minting 5k of the ""Stand with Crypto"" NFT.
2. Nouns DAO donate 55 ETH–$103k at time of writing–to the Gitcoin Crypto Advocacy round, doubling the current matching grant. (Funds will be sent to the [Gitcoin multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6).) 

Note, the Gitcoin round will be concluded by the time this proposal could be executed, but we have been in touch with the Gitcoin team and they are happy to make it work: payouts will happen with some delay after the round is over, so our funds can easily be added to the matching pool. (The matching funds will be allocated at the end of the round to the grantees based on the level of support they all received during the round. More details on matching [here](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=1000).)

## Why 
- Because it is a good thing to do: It is a crucial time for crypto, from a regulatory perspective. The work being done by the organizations in this Gitcoin round is important and we all benefit from it. We also help by signaling our support and raising awareness of the effort. 
- Because it is Nounish: we see generosity and funding things that benefit the crypto community, at large, as core Nounish values. 
- Because it is good for Nouns DAO: giving money to support crypto helps us build good will in the crypto community and attract community members who want to buy a Noun, or join the community generally, because they want to be a part of supporting similar work. There is also significant attention on this mint right now, and the mint amount ""leaderboard,"" and we see this as a unique timely marketing opportunity.

### **TLDR:**
Apple and Google are holding back Web3 mobile development.

ethOS is a free and **open source** mobile OS that embraces Ethereum and makes Web3 delightful on mobile.

We've been building ethOS as a public good for more than a year (currently at ethOS v2.1) without any funding.

Currently, using ethOS requires flashing an older Pixel.

We’d love NounsDAO's support in the launch of a turn-key, consumer friendly ethOS device.

### **Who are we?**

ethOS is a group of nine developers and designers passionate about Ethereum and Web3 who have been building it since winter of 2021.

[@mk](https://warpcast.com/mk) (markkat.eth, Noun 191) wrote the [ΞPhone Manifesto](https://discord.com/channels/910934588073840700/916441442514272327) in 12/22 which kick-started ethOS. He remains an ethOS co-founder. [@markus](https://warpcast.com/markus) (mhaas.eth, https://nf.td/markus)  is also a co-founder and leads development for ethOS. Team ethOS consists of multiple founders, YC Alum, and members with significant Web3 industry experience.

![EthOS Render](https://i.ibb.co/wsP4cTC/Clean-Shot-2023-04-27-at-20-51-41-2x.png)

### **Why are we building ethOS?**

Ethereum on mobile is nerfed by gatekeepers. Most consumer internet activity occurs on mobile devices. However, Android and iOS treat Ethereum as just another application, rather than the protocol that underpins Web3. For example, the iOS OpenSea app doesn’t let you buy, sell, or even _send_ NFTs, because [Apple wants a cut of Ethereum gas fees.](https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/12/01/coinbase-apple-30-percent-fee-digital-wallet/) Uniswap has created an iOS wallet that Apple didn’t approve for months, and [they don’t know why](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1631691337845075968). Furthermore, the Web3 user experience is terrible. Using Ethereum dapps on mobile means browsing within a wallet, and bouncing back and forth between the wallet and the web app. This also prevents new interaction models (such as pay-as-you-stream streaming for audio NFTs). [Apple also does not allow token-gated features](https://decrypt.co/112804/apple-clarifies-app-store-rules-barring-nft-utility-external-purchase-links). Android and iOS are permissioned platforms by design, and this hinders Web3 development. By offering a meaningful alternative, we can push these companies to adopt Ethereum, or lose market share.

ethOS fully embraces Ethereum to unlock the full potential of Web3. ethOS features an onboard Ethereum light node and a System level wallet, allowing for direct interaction between mobile applications and Ethereum, and giving users more security and control over their assets. Unlike iOS and Android, ethOS doesn’t own the App Store. In the spirit of Web3, ethOS supports competition and composability among apps services.

### **Where are we at?**

We launched ethOS v2.0 at ETH Denver 2023, and released ethOS v2.1 last month. We have been building continuously since December 2021. Despite not taking any funding, we maintain a rapid pace of development, and have a long list of exciting functionality and features to bring to ethOS. Some of the cool features of ethOS available today include:

**Onboard light node**
- No need for centralized RPC services pre-merge. Post-merge it gets data from a centralized RPC, but verifies the data using beaconchain data.
- Less man-in-the-middle risk
- Further decentralizes access to Ethereum in the future using the Portal Network

**System-level wallet** 
 - Approves transactions without leaving the browser or app
 - Removes the need for the centralized WalletConnect service

**NFT minting from Gallery/Camera**
 - Create an NFT in seconds

**XMTP messaging**
 - Decentralized messaging between Ethereum or ENS addresses

**ENS integration**
 - Contacts leverage ENS

**Private Key Management via Secure Enclave**
 - Private key is encrypted using symmetric key stored on SPU

**Biometric signing of transactions**
 - Sign a transaction in-app or in-browser with your fingerprint, without having to switch over to the wallet

**Android apps and Services**
 - Install all apps available in the Google Play Store and get traditional Google Play Services for your Android apps

**Three Browser**
 - A full web browser integrated with the system wallet for seamless signing

### **The Purpose of this Proposal**

The purpose of this proposal is to ask for a grant that allows us to launch ethOS devices for anyone to purchase.

Currently, users have to jump through a lot of hoops to try out ethOS. We and our community have been building and testing ethOS on out-of-date devices (Pixel3, 3XL, and 5a). This has enabled us and our community to get devices at a low cost, but it is not a model for widespread adoption. To use ethOS today, users must find and buy used devices, and they must be OEM unlocked (many are incorrectly labeled). This is a major impediment to adoption.

ethOS is now ready for the Web3 community at large, and we are going to make it available pre-installed on current Pixel 7s. To make this happen, we must update ethOS to be compatible with Pixel 7s (a development lift), and establish a delightful sales and quality distribution process (orders on website, sourcing of devices, installation of ethOS, branding/boxing, and fulfillment). Most costs associated with achieving this are for sourcing devices, packing materials, shipping, laser-etching, and developer time.

Our team has worked unpaid thus far; however, three of our developers will be transitioning to a paid status as we begin to sell and support a consumer-grade device. With full time engineers, we can build even faster, and better support the growing ethOS developer community.

This is an important time in the evolution of ethOS, and funding would greatly assist us in this transition.

### **What’s in it for Nouns?**

We believe that building an open source, mobile operating system as a public good is a very Nounish goal. Everyone in the Ethereum ecosystem is aware of the negative effect that Apple and Google gate-keeping has on Web3 mobile. ethOS represents a critical effort to unlock the potential of Ethereum on mobile, and to increase Ethereum adoption.

Our first ethOS device will also have a Nounish option! To thank Nouns for their support, purchasers of the ethOS phone can choose the Nounish Edition, which feature generative Nounish wallpaper, a Noggle-sporting ethOS logo etched on the back of their device, and Nounish packaging to deliver a delightful experience for the user. It will look something like this:

![Nouns Edition](https://i.ibb.co/K5nNQKc/Clean-Shot-2023-04-27-at-21-08-46-2x.png)

We will also prominently thank Nouns for their support on our website and in our social channels for providing the necessary public goods funding for the first ethOS phone.

### **Why we are submitting a Proposal**

We believe that ethOS can be supported in a Web3 native manner that is consistent with the goals of a free and open-source operating system that embraces Ethereum. We have not taken any venture funding to date for this reason. A grant from Nouns would greatly help us advance our mission at this critical time. Furthermore, support from Nouns would raise awareness for ethOS.

### **The Ask and Deliverable**
We are asking for 40 eth (~ $76k) in funding delivered at 0x55A4E5123F8923500fF7AA97e75231a54A9c233a.

We will make the ethOS phone available for purchase in Summer 2023.

Thank you kindly for your consideration,
Team ethOS

## TLDR

NFTR is the NFT identity registry on Ethereum. Let's name our recently acquired jellyfish Noun 687: **JellO** on NFTR.

## Background

[NFTR](https://nftr.name) (pronounced Nifter) stands for NFTRegistry. Founded by Nouner [DigitalOil](https://digitaloil.nftr.name), NFTR is the NFT identity protocol on Ethereum.

Identity starts with **naming**; kind of like ENS but for NFTs instead of wallets. 

Features launching soon: 

1. NFT <> NFT messaging
2. NFT Banking (send money between NFTs)
3. Name marketplace (trade NFT names)

Features launching later:

1. Social NFTs
2. NFT on-chain history and news feeds

Thanks to [Prop 268](https://nouns.wtf/vote/268) we were able to directly bid on and win a Noun.

![Noun 687 soon to have a name](https://i.ibb.co/0QXGxb3/Untitled.png)
Noun 687 soon to have a name

Since our Noun lies in our treasury, we can name it via an on-chain prop.

## Naming Noun 687: JellO

NFTR has assigned a naming credit to the Nouns Treasury so naming JellO is *free*.

I touched upon the idea of naming 687 and Nouner [Supriyo](https://twitter.com/next_roy) suggested the name JellO, which was well received by other Nouners.

## Currently Named Nouns

At the moment, 6 Nouns are named on NFTR.

Let’s name JellO so that it joins the club and gets its own NFTR domain (.nftr) and profile page accesible by name:

## Description
I propose to grow a community of software and hardware developers around Noun-Computers and Noun-Breadbook (aka breadboard). Elegance, versatility, and performance are the three things that make a good single-board computer. Noun-Computers will be much more versatile and convenient than raspberry pi and arduino boards Noun-Computers will enable people to work on much bigger and more ambitious projects thanks to an innovative Noun-breadbook (a reinvented breadboard). The Breadbook is a new type of device that would replace outdated breadboards and allow developers to arrange software and hardware setups more cleanly and understandably. I propose to apply for a few patents and trademarks and later give everyone open access to the inventions if needed.

The Noun-Devices will be available in the $40-$60 price range and distributed strictly using a fixed price policy to ensure that the end users do not overpay. The money from sales will be used to further proliferate NounsDAO by introducing more devices, modules, books, and tutorials. All future products will be branded and aligned with the nounish culture.

NounsDAO can **sponsor ETH Hackathons** by providing the first 400 Noun-Computer kits. Also, 30% of the supply will be allocated to **Nouns-Computer Fund** any nouner will be able to request computers for **Public Good** via an on-chain proposal and send it to developing countries, minority groups, or other purposes.

We can bring NounsDAO to **Consumer Electronic Show (CES**) where we will have an opportunity to talk with big companies and media outlets about how NounsDAO builds an internet government, growth a global community of talented people, enables multidisciplinary collaborations, and funds cool projects with a meaningful impact on the future such as Noun-Computers. We can show the world innovative devices that will be used at universities, schools, and indie projects around the world.

## The problem
![](https://i.imgur.com/g7sIhYL.png)

How can we reach new communities and establish a sustainable proliferation model for NounsDAO? My idea is to grow a community of software and hardware developers around new, affordable, and innovative Noun-Computers. Noun-Computers will win the hearts and minds of developers by improving the software and hardware prototyping experience.
- **[Price and Availability]** Schools and universities do not use a single-board computer in their curriculum due to price inconsistency. For example, raspberry pi 4 boards are advertised to cost $70 but you are never able to buy them at that price. The market price for raspberry pi 4 is over $160. By manufacturing Noun-Computers, we can prevent any price speculations and make truly affordable and widely available single-board computers.
![](https://i.imgur.com/Oqo5Ojb.png)

- **[Versatility & Capability]** 
The Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook would be very intuitive and easy to use. A well-selected combination of features, interfaces and elements placement on the board would allow to free the working space for other elements/modules. The Noun-Computers performance will be enough to run ETH staking node, run deep learning and computer vision applications. The Noun-Computer will be a size of a credit card that can work as a stand-alone device or with a Noun-Breadbook. We are going to fit the following features:
    - AM62Ax Sitara, Arm Cortex-A53 1.4 GHz
    - M.2 ports x2 for SSD, GPS modules expansion
    - MicroSD x1
    - Bluetooth & WiFi
    - Ethernet
    - 40-pin GPIO Header
    - USB-C x3 for power, tethered connection, peripherals, monitor, etc

![](https://i.imgur.com/R0Ol8Uo.png)
- **[Aesthetic]** Existing single-board computers use ports and dongles (HDMI, ethernet, USB) that raise the cost, limit portability, and result in bad aesthetics. Custom simple boards (microcontroller based) give you better aesthetics but limited functionality. Likewise, Custom Systems (CPU based) would have good aesthetics and capability but are too expensive to design for individuals. Noun-Computers would allow greater flexibility in developing tidy electronic prototypes with custom expansion boards that feature USB-C ports, plug-in card connectors, and digital pins. Below is an image of breadboard-based setups. One of the core problems is that the breadboard-based prototyping setups are not portable, clumsy, and difficult to keep in one piece hence you can't work on your great ideas from a coffee shop or take your work to a class. Likewise, it is hard to use breadboard-based projects to explain your software and hardware ideas in a concise, precise, and understandable manner. The breadboard was invented back in the 1880s and there was no innovation in the breadboard design in the past 143 years! ([""Electrical Switch board""](https://patents.google.com/patent/US231708A)).
![](https://i.imgur.com/4PX7sxT.png)

## Noun-Computer
![](https://i.imgur.com/wMkKAC9.png)
Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook are new devices that provide a foundation for inexpensive software and hardware prototyping. Noun-Devices will enable any developer to build clean, portable, and good-looking hardware prototypes that work. We will be able to reach and educate millions of developers around the globe and build nounish dev communities. With Noun-Computers, NounsDAO will win the hearts and minds of developers. All the devices will be designed to be best in performance, price, and user experience categories.

The Noun-Computer will compete in performance and price with raspberry pi and arduino boards. The devices will be sold via a fixed price policy to ensure that end users do not overpay.
The Noun-Devices will cost $40-$60. Similar devices on the market are advertised as cheap but usually sold for $100~$160. The money from sales will be used to introduce more nounish devices, books, tutorials, and sponsor eth hackathons.

All documentation, tutorials, and books will use nouns assets as well as electrical components on the computer boards will be arranged in the form of noggles.

## Noun-Breadbook
Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook are new devices that work together and provide a fundamentally new way to work on software and hardware projects. Noun-Breadbook is a reinvented breadboard and my original idea and I would love to work with NounsDAO to bring this game-changing device to life. The key to success is to make Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook complement each other and work together as one modular system. I believe that Noun-Devices will be widely accepted at universities, schools, startups, and indie dev. It is an expensive project but has a great return on investment and will be a sustainable way to proliferate NounsDAO. We can put Nouns to [Consumer Electronic Show](https://www.ces.tech/) in Las Vegas and generate a lot of positive exposure to NounDAO through press and tv.

![](https://i.imgur.com/MMmpIQq.png)
The Noun-Breadbook will replace old breadboards allowing easy connection of modules to a Noun-Computer. The pages will be available in different configurations that would increase the versatility of the whole system. The breadbook binder will be made from aluminum. The main function of the binder is to connect pages, supply power, and connect the board to ports such as HDMI, USB-C, and AUDIO.

![](https://i.imgur.com/USOoae5.png)
The pages of the Noun-Breadbook would be assembled from layers of paper, encapsulation, cathode, and anode. The pages are going to provide a base for soldering components. The pages will be flexible and made using technology used in the production of flexible displays. The Noun-Breadbook will be lightweight and flexible to enable compact design and portability.

I have been working in academia for a long time and know that new devices such as Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook would significantly improve user experience and inspire people to work on bigger and more ambitious projects.

## Using Noun-Breadbook as an interactive textbook
An interactive book based on Noun-Breadbook will be the most nounish book in academia, period! The design of Noun-Computer and Breadbook would allow people to work on creative projects. For example, users will be able to use blank pages to document their work and development progress. Likewise, users will be able to share their work by sharing printable breadbooks. Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook would be appreciated by universities and schools around the globe. It is also possible that in the future the Breadbook would be adopted as a learning platform by Computer Science and Engineering schools.

![](https://i.imgur.com/fr00zAZ.jpg)
Here are the photos of how the Noun-Computer and Noun-breadbook would enhance user experience.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Nhe3Hz3.jpg)
The pages can be used to give instructions to a user.

![](https://i.imgur.com/lFKpnUB.jpg)
I will write a book with five complete tutorials that will teach how to develop applications for cameras, graphics, networks, I/O interfaces, and servo controllers. For example, a Camera Lab would like something like this where you can learn everything you need to know to develop applications from scratch. In this Lab, you will learn about the implementation and design patterns of camera applications. For example: take photos and videos; object/face tracking; mapping environment

![](https://i.imgur.com/0yUM0xL.jpg)
This Lab will teach you everything you need to know to program computer graphics from scratch. In this Lab, you will learn about the implementation and design patterns of beautiful UI and animations.

## Deliverables
- Sponsor ETH Hackathons, and provide 400 Noun-Computer kits for competitions
- Donate 30% of supply to developing countries and minority groups
- Photo & Video report every month on the state of the progress
- Invention patents (to be released for open access)
- Booths at Consumer Electronic Show & Mobile World Congress
- Guest Lectures at 20 Universities around the globe
- A Noun-Computer will be available in the $40-$60 price range
- A Blank Noun-Breadbook will be available in the $50-$70 price range
- An Interactive Noun-Breadbook will be available in the $90 - $130 price range

The money from sales of the devices will be used to support future development and manufacturing.

## Timeline
**Phase I&II - Prototypes v0.1~1 (4 months)**
Nowadays, the development and manufacturing of a single-board computer might be trivial given the available knowledge. However, the challenge is to design a perfect combination of single board computer and breadbook layout that would give people the freedom to build creative circuits and prototypes.
- [May~Aug 2023] Manufacture and test first 100 Noun-Computer prototypes
- [Sep 2023] Sponsor ETH global hackathon NY by providing Noun-Computers for hardware competitions

**Phase III - Mass Manufacturing (5 months)**
Mass manufacturing of Noun-Computer devices would require the development of manufacturing methods, safety approvals, quality control tests, etc. Manufacturing is a difficult process and it would be best to outsource it to a third-party company. There are a lot of companies that manufacture PCBs and electronic devices in Korea. We just need to invest time and money into developing requirements, manufacturing methods, and quality control.
- [Sep~Oct 2023] Prototype v2
- [Nov 2023] Mass production
- [Jan 2024] Showcase Noun-Computers and Noun-Breadbook at CES and MWC, two of the most prestigious consumer electronics shows

**Phase IV - Proliferation**
The proliferation phase is the time when the NounsDAO will be able to harvest fruits from its investment. We will bring NounsDAO to CES, where we alongside with most innovative companies. I will personally visit 10+ universities and give guest lectures and master classes on Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook. I will write an Interactive book based on Noun-Breadbook that will be used for ages to come.
- Raise additional capital from investors (Shark tank) and put Noun-Computers in schools, universities, and malls around the US.

## Budget
It is hard to give an exact size of the budget for such a project. However, in my experience, designing embedded systems, necessary software, manufacturing cost, and safety approvals and patents would be around $1.1 million. All excess money will be sent back to the NounsDAO treasury on March 1, 2024.

**Phase I - Prototyping Noun-Computer (4 months)**
**$150,000** - Noun-Computer prototype, stand with ports, and firmware development
 - Select components (Processor, DRAM, Interfaces etc)
 - Circuit design
 - PCB artwork with 6~8 layers (noggles themed)
 - Prototype manufacturing and testing

**$50,000** - 1/2 fiveoceans_dev's compensation (I will use this funds to work full time on Nouns-Computers and offset prototyping expenses.
**Subtotal: $200,000**

**Phase II - Prototyping Noun-Breadbook (3 months)**
**$170,000** - Noun-Breadbook prototype development and manufacturing methods
 - Binder and flexible pages concept design
 - Breadbook-pages prototype manufacturing using methods used in flexible electronics
 - Binder2pages interface prototyping
 - Pages2modules interface prototyping

**$50,000** - 2/2 fiveoceans_dev's compensation (I will use this funds to offset expenses and write an interactive book based on Noun-Breadbook for electrical engineering and computer science majors). The book will be another opportunity to establish a long proliferation strategy for NounsDOA.
**Subtotal: $220,000**

**Phase III - Manufacturing (5 months)**
**$450,000** - Mass production of Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook (3,000~5,000 pcs).
- 400 Noun-Computer kits will be distributed at ETH hackathons to promote NounsDAO.
- Additional 400 Noun-Computers will be distributed to minorities and volunteers who have a passion to support Ethereum infrastructure by running Ethereum nodes (see https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-x-ethereum-nodes/3256)
- Furthermore, 30% of the supply will be allocated to Noun-Computers Fund and will be sent to developing countries, minority groups, or other purposes at the request of the Nouners using a separate on-chain vote.

**$120,000** - Patent and trademark applications (From my experience, it is best to apply for patents and trademarks and later offer open access to everyone if needed)
**Subtotal: $570,000**

**Phase IV - Proliferation (∞)**
**$110,000** - Nouns-Computers booth at 2023 Consumer Electronics Show, Las Vegas
**$0** - I will try my luck and apply to Shark Tank to raise additional investment and put Noun-Computers in every school, institute, and mall
**$0** - Guest Lectures about NounsDAO and Noun-Computers at the 10 best Universities in the USA, EUROPE, and ASIA (MIT, Harvard, etc)
**Subtotal: $110,000**
____
**Phase I - $200,000**
**Phase II - $220,000**
**Phase III - $570,000**
**Phase IV - $110,000**

**TOTAL: $1,100,000**

## 4/7 Multi-sig
1. The funds for Phase I will be transferred to fiveoceans_dev in USD.
2. The funds for Phase II, III, and IV will be kept in a 4/7 multi-sig safe and transferred to fiveoceans_dev upon completion of each development phase.

## Q&A

#### 1. $1.1 million is a lot of money. Why not execute the project in several smaller phases?
I spend a long time debating myself what is the best option to ask NounsDAO to fund the Noun-Computers project. Some members prefer to fund a proof of concept and request builders to submit proposals for recurrent funding. This option helps to protect the treasury from bad actors who do not keep their promises. To give the members confidence, we request that 82% of the funds be sent to a multi-sig safe with 4/7 well-known signers. Requesting a full amount at once would make it clear how much funds the DAO needs to commit to accomplish the full project. It also would allow me to focus only on execution.

#### 2. What's in it for NounsDAO?
The NounsDAO would benefit by building a community of developers, onboarding student programmers, helping communities in need, and diversifying/decentralizing the Ethereum network. The first group of users is devs at ETH Global hackathons. I believe many enthusiasts would like to run an Ethereum staking node or develop applications. The second group of users is university students. There is a real opportunity to do a public good by teaching students programming, finding new blockchain builders, invite people to NounsDAO. The third group of users are people who can not afford a laptop. NounsDAO will be able to donate 30% of the supply of Noun-Computers to developing countries and minority groups. The fourth group is blockchain enthusiasts. There are not many affordable single-board computers that are specifically developed to run an Ethereum node. Currently, plug-and-play nodes cost $1,600~$3,500. Or alternative based on a raspberry pi 4 with all the dongles would cost around $360.

#### 3. Why not allocate 100% of the supply to NounsDAO?
It is a very expensive project, and I believe it should have a long-term vision to guarantee a return on investment for NounsDAO. I am always very careful with the promises I make. In this proposal, I promise to allocate 30% or around 900~1,500 units of the supply to the Noun-Computers fund. Any nouner will be able to request the computer by submitting a proposal similar to Nouns Vision noggles. The rest of the supply will be sold and around $650,000 will be used to manufacture the next batch of Noun-Computers and develop new devices, modules, and tutorials. I think with that capital we will be able to continue growing the community around Noun-computers.

#### 4. Why not just buy and give away raspberry pi computers?
It is a great option however, it is extremely difficult to buy a large batch of raspberry pi computers due to unavailability. Also, the prices are often determined by resellers. It is also much more meaningful to onboard new developers with nounish devices. Another big part of the proposal is to bring NounsDAO to ETH global hackathons and CES with new devices such as Noun-Breadbook.

#### 5. Who are the end users of Noun-Computers?
The target users are devs at ETH Global hackathons,  blockchain supporters, university students, minority groups, and people in developing countries.

#### 6. What would differentiate this from any other box of components and controller or other guides on the Internet? What are we multiplying here or what is this teaching differently?
By developing Noun-Computer and Breadbook we will be able to set a new standard for software and hardware prototyping. First, these devices will be affordable and available at a fixed price. Second, the form factor of the devices would allow users to freely bring their setups with them. Third, users will be able to develop good-looking setups that others can easily understand and follow. It is going to be a much more satisfying educational platform to learn coding and hacking. We can provide a solution to millions of people while continuously proliferating NounsDAO.

#### 7. What SBC design will the board be based on? What SOM/ application processor would you use and have you done much of that design work before?
The main differences are MPUs have a ball grid array that has a high pin count and requires a more complex PCB Routing. Also, MPUs operate at GHz frequencies that require all signal routes to be of the same length/topology. Last, PCB boards for MPUs have more complex ICs and would require at least 6-8 layers. I previously designed boards with MCUs and working on an MPU board is new to me. For me working on projects with Nouns is also a learning opportunity.  I think constantly learning, new opportunities, and working with the community are what make NounsDAo so fun. Of course, I would use the help of my peers from academia to fine-tune the designs. I would like to design a Noun-Computer around AM62Ax Sitara MPU with Arm Cortex-A53 1.4 GHz. The SBC will feature the following ports and interfaces.
- AM62Ax Sitara, Arm Cortex-A53 1.4 GHz
- M.2 ports x2 for SSD, GPS modules, etc
- MicroSD x1
- Bluetooth & WiFi
- Ethernet
- 40-pin GPIO Header
- USB-C x3 for power, tethered connection, peripherals, monitor, etc

#### 9. Did you consider receiving compensation in Nouns instead?
I would love someday to call myself a nouner! I would definitely try to save some of the money from compensation to acquire a noun (I requested two payments of $50,000 each as my compensation for this project). If this project will be approved I would need to work full time and dedicate myself to making a great Noun-Computer. Monetary compensation would give me the needed freedom to focus and succeed. I also think this project has a good chance to be profitable because the number of potential customers is huge. So it will be possible not only to guarantee the continuous proliferation of NounsDAO but also to return some of the money to the treasury by acquiring Nouns.",CANCELLED,17194115,17230115,1,139,,1000000,1000,2000,695,2,105,0,"['0', '0', '608258215288947069891']","['0xd97bcd9f47cee35c0a9ec1dc40c1269afc9e8e1d', '0xd97bcd9f47cee35c0a9ec1dc40c1269afc9e8e1d', '0x4f2acdc74f6941390d9b1804fabc3e780388cfe5']","['sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)', 'sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)', '']",17158115,1682848631,0xd62898199df3593ec822e7eaddacd7ec1a6871294fd0e4749ae7a33f3db8fac1,"['0x000000000000000000000000df6e59c6df1e9500fd35a76ff4c62f9901e900190000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002e90edd000', '0x000000000000000000000000ec33f935a436d704cb50c4d94afe49fa253b53fd000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000d18c2e2800', '0x']",0xdf6e59c6df1e9500fd35a76ff4c62f9901e90019
282,Dynamic Quorum Updates,"# Dynamic Quorum Updates

**Author: [Nounlius](https://twitter.com/nounlius)**
**TL;DR - reduce max quorum from 20% to 15%**

**Dynamic Quorum Parameter Updates**
As articulated in this [detailed post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE), three parameters need to be set for dynamic quorum.

**CURRENT SETTINGS**
Minimum quorum %: currently set to 10%
Maximum quorum %: currently set to 20%
Coefficient: currently set to 1, such that each against vote raises the quorum requirement by one vote, until the maximum quorum is reached.

**PROPOSED SETTINGS**
Minimum quorum %: 10% (no change)
Maximum quorum %: set to 15%
Coefficient: 1 (no change)

**RATIONALE**

[Prop 261](https://nouns.wtf/vote/261) recently adjusted Dynamic Quorum to ensure only ""Hell Yes"" proposals are executed. The stated rationale was the following

> 1. Dynamic quorum was designed so that contentious proposals would require a higher degree of support.
> 2. Maximum quorum is currently too low to have changed the outcome of any recent proposals.
> 3. Increasing maximum quorum should increase the percentage of successful proposals that are ""hell yes"" initiatives.

What appears to be conveniently left out is the ""Why"" behind [Dynamic Quorum](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE): which was to protect the DAO from voter apathy as an attack vector in an effort to move the DAO one step closer to removing the veto.

The recent change is a misuse of this DAO parameter to serve a particular point of view. As Wilson Cusack [pointed out](https://twitter.com/WilsonCusack/status/1644338325908606976/photo/1), functionally speaking Dynamic Quorum serves to privilege against votes. 

Generally speaking, contentious proposals lead to higher voter turnout. There may be a case to be made that setting Dynamic Quorum to 0 would incentivize higher voter participation and/or delegation—which would increase DAO health. The inverse may also be true, the higher the dynamic quorum the less incentive there is to participate on the margins given the increases barrier to successful proposals—which reduces DAO health.

This proposal will revert to *Maximum Quorum's* original setting of 15%, meanwhile encouraging further discussion on whether or not to remove the Dynamic Quorum altogether.

## **TL;DR** 
- Allocate **75,800 USDC** for the development of **wears.wtf⌐◨-◨**, a  clothing brand that transforms Nouns' incredible CC0 assets into distinctive, ready-to-wear clothing.
- By **collaborating with [LEBLANCSTUDIOS](https://www.instagram.com/leblancstudios/?hl=en), a fashion brand with 10+ years in experience**, we seek to bring wears.wtf⌐◨-◨ to market very smoothly. 
    - Initial collection marketing will be directed towards the Nounish Ecosystem, Twitter, and LEBLANCSTUDIOS' customer base (3500+ customers). 
- This process will be divided in 2 phases: [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] and [PRODUCTION EXPANSION].
    - **[PROOF-OF-DEMAND]** is this **current** proposal.
        - Includes a 100-200 piece test limited-edition drop to measure demand and other metrics. 
        - After the test drop, we'll be launching a 400 piece drop focused on the nounssentials line (explained later on the prop). 
    - **[PRODUCTION EXPANSION]** would be a **future** proposal. 
    - After both phases are done, wears.wtf⌐◨-◨ will effectively become completely self-sustainable,and will keep iterating, experimenting, and ultimately growing as a business & platform. 
- wears.wtf⌐◨-◨ opens up endless possibilities, such as creating limited edition clothing for an specific cause, designing apparel inspired by Nouns community events, and incorporating fashion into proposals across various domains.

## **THE WEARS.WTF TEAM** 

[LEBLANCSTUDIOS](https://www.instagram.com/leblancstudios/?hl=en). A Dominican clothing brand founded in 2014. With an awareness of globalization, highlighting personal identity, LEBLANCSTUDIOS strives to become a social and cultural  movement that empowers an emerging generation of people across all continents to express themselves.  **LEBLANCSTUDIOS is available among retailers like [ODIN NYC](https://odinnewyork.com/) (USA) and [THE FORUMIST](https://store.theforumist.com/) (EUROPE)**.
- **LEBLANCSTUDIOS will provide the following talent to the wears.wtf team**: 
    - 2 Senior Creative Directors & Co-Founders of LEBLANCSTUDIOS:
        -  Angelo Beato & Yamil Arbaje
    - Fashion Marketer, Pattern Maker, Material Sourcing Specialist, Production Manager, Sales/E-COMM Manager, Graphic Designer, Copywriter, Editor

- **LEBLANCSTUDIOS is also providing already established partnerships with manufacturers in the following countries**: Turkey, Peru, India, Italy, Portugal, China, USA


[necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas). I (necfas) have always desired to wear clothing that embodies the essence of Nouns in one way or another. Rather than purchasing generic t-shirts and having them embroidered or printed myself, I wanted apparel that genuinely reflects the unique significance that Nouns hold for me. As the nounish creative lead, my role is to ensure that the designs we create are in sync with the Nouns culture. I will be responsible for providing creative suggestions and guidance, aiming to produce intriguing and exceptional designs that best represent the essence of Nouns. This is a genuine, wholehearted attempt to offer something that could potentially bring significant value to the DAO. 



## **2 PHASES**
### [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] & [PRODUCTION EXPANSION]

- This phase aims to gauge the community's interest in the clothing line by producing a limited-edition, low-supply (100-200) collection. After the test drop, we'll be launching a 400 piece drop focused on the nounssentials line. Phase 1's marketing will be focused towards the Nouns community, twitter, and LEBLANCSTUDIOS' customer base. We will use promotional videos and clothing shoots to gather attention for the launch. 

    -  **Phase 1 will clearly define the following metrics**:
        - Cost of Goods Sold 
        - Gross Margin
        - Operating Expenses
        - Net Profit Margin
        - Sell-through Rate
        - Conversion Rate
        - Average Order Value (AOV)
        - Return on Investment (ROI) - limited to the scale of the first collection
    
*The wears.wtf team will produce reports of these metrics on a regular basis in order to be as transparent as possible.* 

- Once PROOF-OF-DEMAND is completed, we'll move on to the next phase PRODUCTION EXPANSION, a future proposal. We'll start producing the other clothing lines, like NOUNSWEAR and NOUNSJACKETS (explained later in the prop). 
    - After the Production Expansion phase, the project will be able to support itself, and we'll always include special Nounish details in our branding to maintain the origin. We'll also make sure nounssentials are available to purchase online everyday, forever. Phase 2 will include a thourough marketing campaign that will focus on expanding to a broader audience, including non-crypto-natives by leveraging all of the metrics acquired during phase 1. 

    -  **Phase 2 will clearly define the following metrics**:
        - Inventory Turnover
        - Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) 
        - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
        - Conversion Rate
        - Customer Retention Rate
        - Return on Investment (ROI) - overall various collections



## **HOW**

 **Collaboration and Design Process**: 
- The LEBLANCSTUDIOS' team and I (necfas) have worked to create unique designs that resonate with the Nouns community. The design process will involve brainstorming, sketching, and refining concepts that embody the essence of the community and its values.
-  This collaboration ensures that the final designs are a perfect blend of art, fashion, and what's considered nounish.

**Design Selection and Production**: 
- After gathering feedback and iterating on the designs, the team will finalize 8 different designs for the nounssentials drop, once the [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] limited edition TEST drop is complete.
- the [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] limited edition TEST drop will consist of 100-200 limited edition pieces.
- The nounssentials 8 final designs, 400 piece drop will be done afterwards. 

*note: Scaling down production was considered, but even if the Nouns ecosystem doesn’t purchase the proposed amounts, LEBLANCSTUDIOS’ customer base will. They’ve shown excitement for the unique designs they’ve never seen before. It’s crucial for us to begin working on the next collection batch right after the test drop. Going through another proposal process, which would cause weeks of funding delay, wouldn’t be optimal for securing production spots and establishing dates with the manufacturers by paying upfront.*

**Quality and Sustainability**: 
- The wears.wtf team has prioritized finding the best sustainable quality/price ratio for the garments. 
- We are in contact with reputable manufacturers to ensure ethically made clothing, and that the final products are not only stylish and comfortable but also durable. 

**Community Feedback and Iteration**: 
- Throughout the design process, the team will engage with the community through twitter & discord (JUNGLE, NOUNISH, NOUNCIL) to gather feedback on the proposed designs.
-  By conducting polls, discussions, and sharing design mockups, the team will ensure that the community's preferences and ideas are taken into account. This iterative approach will help refine the designs, making them more appealing to the community members.

**Launching the First Collection**: 
- Once the designs are finalized and produced, the first drop of the wears.wtf collection will be launched. This collection will focus on creating clothing that embodies the ""Clothing, Every Day, Forever"" concept, making it an essential piece for every Nouns community member's wardrobe. 
- By offering versatile and stylish garments, the collection aims to become an integral part of the community members' daily lives, allowing them to express their Nounishness.


## **CLOTHING, EVERYDAY, FOREVER** 

### **NOUNSSENTIALS: Made for everyone. For Everyday, Forever.**
- **Essential clothes** **made** **from sustainable materials** include items like organic cotton t-shirts, hemp or linen pants, and bamboo socks. By choosing sustainable materials for our everyday clothing, we can make a positive impact on the environment while also staying comfortable and stylish.

### **NOUNSJACKET: Nounish Representation**

- The NOUNSJACKET **aims to be a set of tailor made jacket for different NOUNISH BUILDERS that have constant exposure to a wide audience** (Nouns Fair, Aubtoshi, Becco, Nounsesports, etc).
- The jackets will be designed through back and forth conversations with differet builders about their preferences and the representative elements they would like in their jackets. Builders will be able to contact the team in order to tailor-make their jacket with the specific requirements they would want.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Wg7vavU.png)
*THESE ARE NOT FINAL DESIGNS*


## **THIS ISN'T MERCH, THIS IS READY-TO-WEAR**
- **Ready-to-wear clothing offers a superior level of comfort and everyday wearability compared to merch, thanks to its focus on quality materials, design, fit, and attention to detail**. These collections will be crafted by experienced designers who prioritize the use of high-quality fabrics and materials, ensuring a more comfortable and durable experience. 
- Moreover, ready-to-wear pieces will be meticulously designed with silhouette, fit, and proportion in mind, providing a better overall fit and feel. **The versatility of ready-to-wear clothing makes it easy for consumers to incorporate these pieces into their daily wardrobe**, as they offer a range of styles that can be easily mixed and matched.


## **WHAT DOES A CC0 CLOTHING BRAND LOOK LIKE?**
- We believe that wears⌐◨-◨.wtf has the potential to innovate in fashion by leveraging CC0 assets to create unique and innovative clothing designs. 
- By incorporating elements from various web3 projects and the broader public domain, wears.wtf can develop a diverse range of apparel that reflects the creative spirit of the internet and empowers individuals to express their unique identities.
- As Nouns allows for this CC0-POWERED clothing brand, integration and collaboration with other artists, brands, and CC0 projects can lead to outstanding success by exploring a niche with a format that no one is currently exploring. 


## **TIMELINE [PROOF-OF-DEMAND]**
![](https://i.imgur.com/CqaF99V.png)
*TOTAL 26 WEEKS*
*AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE: EARLY NOVEMBER*


## **PHASE 2: [PRODUCTION EXPANSION]** 
- The subsequent proposal will focus on funding a larger production and adopting a more targeted approach, informed by the metrics gathered during this initial phase. All profits generated in this first phase will be reinvested by wears.wtf to minimize expenses required for execution.
    - In this phase, we'll develop NOUNSSENTIALS, NOUNSWEAR, and NOUNSJACKETS in collection sizes that meet the growing demand. 
    - After Phase 2, wears.wtf will be a self-sustainable project that proudly represents its origins in Nouns. 
        - After developing all Nounish lines, we'll then be open to explore collaborations with other communities like Cryptoadz, Checks, Opepen, CryptoDickButts, Mfers, Rektguy, etc. 

- As crypto, NFTs, and Web3 continue to grow, so will our consumer base. Together with LEBLANCSTUDIOS, we're dedicated to creating high-quality products that people will love not just for the designs, but for the quality as well.

***Wears.wtf aims to establish itself as a valuable platform powered by Nouns, with the goal of creating a long-term project that benefits not only the Nouns ecosystem but also the broader web3 community.***

![Nouns x PizzaDAO Global Pizza Party|690x239, 100%](https://i.postimg.cc/8CgTFnjF/Group-10-1-1.png)




We want to “Nounify” the world’s largest (decentralized) pizza party! We’re requesting $42,000 in funding to support PizzaDAO’s third global pizza party for [Bitcoin Pizza Day](https://twitter.com/RarePizzas/status/1528475500993208323) on May 22, 2023. Through this grant we’re seeking to co-brand Nouns x PizzaDAO’s Bitcoin Pizza Day events currently being organized in 90+ cities around the globe.

All funds collected through this grant will go towards purchasing pizza from independent pizzerias on Bitcoin Pizza Day for our pizza parties all over the world. [Learn more about PizzaDAO and Rare Pizzas here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNdbUERvVN4)

## TLDR ⌐◧-◧

This proposal directly funds 12,000+ slices of pizza that will be distributed through local PizzaDAO events and community organizations on May 22, 2023.

1. **Nounifying Bitcoin Pizza Day** Onboarding communities one slice at a time. Co-branding marketing materials, events, and media reaching tens of thousands of participants globally.
2. **Nounish Pizza Parties** Proliferation through pizza and furthering Nouns OTG presence at PizzaDAO events
3. **Nounish Social Activation** Nouns x PizzaDAO claimable NFT for event participants and online proliferators





![Pizza Noun 292 and Molto Benny|690x345, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/CxvDXsy5/1.png)





We believe that PizzaDAO is well-aligned as a Nounish brand partner for Nouns and our Global Pizza Party for Bitcoin Pizza Day provides a low-risk opportunity to advance proliferation of Nouns through earned media and activations at IRL events – all while doing some good and bringing people together with free pizza.

PizzaDAO has been an active member of the Nounish community with our pizza parties at web3 conference events and in the Nounish community more broadly. This funding proposal would cement the vibes and values of PizzaDAO and Nouns together as well as spread the messages of community and funding weird stuff around the globe.

PizzaDAO recently joined Nouns as a new member sub-DAO through the acquisition of the ""We Pizza"" Noun 292 and is committed to expanding the Nounish ecosystem through its events and network of contributors.

## WHO WE ARE ⌐◧-◧

We are a global community of hackers, pizza enthusiasts, NFT creators, collectors, artists and rebels who believe in using crypto to make the world a better place.

PizzaDAO’s community is made up of new entrants to the industry and members that have been in the crypto space for years, including several NounsDAO members, early Bitcoin community organizers, Gitcoin KERNEL Fellows, and past award recipients. PizzaDAO alumni now work on countless other projects in the crypto space, a direct result of our commitment to education and onboarding.

## OUR IMPACT ⌐◧-◧

To date, PizzaDAO has given away over $600,000 worth of real, edible pizza in more than 75 countries. You might have eaten some during previous global pizza parties or at NFT.NYC, DCentral Miami, NFT Paris, NFT Sydney, ETHDenver, SXSW, NFTLA, Consensus, or one of the many smaller events we've supported. Now, we need your help!

* Over 200,000 slices served
* Over 500 pizzerias supported
* Presence in 75+ countries
* Thousands of people onboarded to web3
* Over $600,000 of pizza given away!

## OUR MODEL ⌐◧-◧

Rare Pizzas is a cc0 project founded by the decentralized autonomous organization PizzaDAO. We came together on February 18th, 2021 to make 10,000 generative pizzas in a one-of-a-kind collaboration between 314 international toppings artists. This collaboration has gone on to raise over $1M through the sale of the NFTs, funding two global pizza parties and a large number of community events. As we build, our ultimate goal is to build solutions for independent pizzerias (software, marketing, consulting, etc.) and eventually conduct individual token-raises to enable communities to buy out their local pizzeria’s landlord and sign a rental contract with the pizzeria.

## Nouns x PizzaDAO Bitcoin Pizza Day 2023 ⌐◧-◧

Bitcoin Pizza Day is already the one de facto crypto holiday. Together as a community, we can grow this celebration of cryptocurrency and pizza into a truly global event. The internet, cryptocurrency, and pizza are all global phenomena. Bringing them together by giving away free pizza funded by the blockchain is a strong invitation to the general public to join our ecosystem. We think that’s pretty Nounish!

![PizzaDAO Global Pizza Party 2022 on an active volcano|690x407, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/V6FzZ4TH/Screenshot-2023-04-24-at-4-24-19-PM.png)

### Nounifying Bitcoin Pizza Day ⌐◧-◧

We want to onboard communities one slice at a time. Our goal is to Nounify Bitcoin Pizza Day while creating touch points with potential collaborators through IRL activations at community events. Nouns assets will be integrated throughout PizzaDAO’s marketing materials, events, and branding to highlight the partnership, presenting Nouns as the core contributor for PizzaDAO’s global pizza party 2023.

![Molto Benny x Nouns|649x322, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/qv9BNNyQ/Screenshot-2023-04-24-at-4-19-21-PM.png)


### Nounish Pizza Parties ⌐◧-◧

Having Nounish gear present at our pizza parties makes a lasting impression on our guests. Nouns Pizza Party Kits featuring props and swag will be sent to organizers to allow attendees to participate in Nounish photobooths and other IRL activations. Parties will also feature cardboard cutouts of PizzaDAO’s ""We Pizza"" Noun #292 and co-branded material will be visible to attendees throughout the event and on social media. We had a strong Nounish presence at our Wen Pizza? party during NFT NYC and  a similarly strong presence at our event during Consensus ATX (we ordered a $600 box of Noun props from Big Shot Toyworks). See the results in videos like [this one](https://twitter.com/Pizza_DAO/status/1652495611445354497), which has over 8k views so far.

### Nounish Social Activation ⌐◧-◧

Nouns x PizzaDAO NFTs designed by Nounish builder BigShotToyWorks featuring PizzaDAO’s pizza noun #292. QR code signs will be displayed at premier parties featuring PizzaDAO x Nouns Global Pizza Party branding to allow participants to claim a “PizzaNounies” NFT.

### **WHY?**  ⌐◧-◧

We’re helping pizzerias around the world use crypto to empower their businesses while giving back to their communities. We believe that we can assist businesses to become community owned by tokenizing the pizzerias in our network using open source technology. Beyond that, we believe that pizza is a public good and that Rare Pizzas’ Art to Pizza model can be replicated to solve some of the world’s biggest problems while spreading joy (and sauce).

We created our Global Pizza Party as an accessible and fun way to get introduced to and utilize blockchain technologies. Plus, throwing a global pizza party is a good team-building exercise for Spaceship Earth!

* We believe markets can be positive sum and can enrich communities
* We believe that we can use digital scarcity to bring analog plenty
* We believe artists deserve to be honored and compensated
* We believe anyone should be allowed to help others without asking for permission
* We believe memes are powerful vessels for raising awareness
* We believe in equal inclusion of all pizza toppings (yes, even pineapple)

## FUNDING BREAKDOWN ⌐◧-◧

15% of funds collected through this grant will be used to purchase Nouns Pizza Party Kits containing Nouns swag and props from BigShotToyWorks. The remaining 85% of the funds collected through this grant will be used to purchase pizza from independent pizzerias all over the world for our events.

## TL:DR 

Nouns leads the NFT movement in Brazil thanks to its community, but we are just getting started. We are proposing a huge Sao Paulo city takeover starting in NFT.Brasil event.

Our goal is to achieve a massive and innovative onboarding experience for all attendees, and to do so, we will be present in five strategic areas throughout the event journey. These include the NFT Exhibition, Speaker Sessions, Lounge, Metaverse, and Street Gallery ([Eletromedia](https://eletromidia.com.br/) OOH advertising). 

![](https://i.imgur.com/3CH4aRq.png)

NFT.Brasil is a pioneering conference celebrating the cutting-edge advancements and possibilities of the NFT world that is set to take place in Sao Paulo city, **Brazil on June 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, 2023.**

We want to bring Nouns to NFT.Brasil. The event is expected to attract over 30,000 individuals. The venue is the iconic Bienal, which is a true masterpiece of contemporary design, and is a premier cultural destination in Brazil.

## What is NFT.Brasil?

Get ready to witness an exciting fusion of art, technology, and innovation at NFT.Brasil, a pioneering conference that is all set to take place in the heart of Sao Paulo. Hosted at the iconic Bienal, the event promises to be a one-of-a-kind experience that brings together digital artists and web3 builders from across Brazil.

![](https://i.imgur.com/WS14MiW.gif)

The mockup video gives you a sneak peek of what's to come: [click here to watch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCPjVRjLDA)

The Bienal, also known as the Biennial Pavilion, is a landmark cultural institution located in the heart of São Paulo, Brazil. It was designed by the legendary Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and was first opened in 1951 to host the São Paulo Art Biennial, which is one of the world's most prestigious art exhibitions. 

Hosting the NFT.Brasil conference at the Bienal is a testament to the venue's reputation as a premier cultural destination, and it promises to be an ideal setting for the fusion of art and technology that is at the heart of the NFT movement.

![](https://i.imgur.com/0gS9Ksp.jpg)

The event will be held on June 2nd, 3rd, and 4th and will be divided into two areas. The NFT exhibition will showcase Brazilian and international artists, collections, projects, and DAOs. The second area will host talks and lectures, bringing the community together to discuss the technology and its impact on our present and future. With a combination of NFT art exhibitions and speaker sessions, the event expects to attract over 30,000 individuals seeking knowledge, connections, and business opportunities in the field.

![](https://i.imgur.com/GupEgWM.jpg)

With a population of over 12 million residents, São Paulo is one of the largest and most vibrant cities in the world, making it the perfect backdrop for this exciting event. 

## What does Nouns gets by funding this proposal?

Besides being a huge celebration of the Nouns community in Brazil and what we've been building for 9 months after NFT.Rio, and also being a great chance to bring new people on board, Nouns DAO will get:

### Open-air NFT exhibition - [Eletromedia](https://eletromidia.com.br/)

For 20 days, NFT.Brasil will host the largest open-air NFT exhibition in the world. In partnership with Eletromedia, Brazil's leading Out of Home media company, NFT.Brasil will showcase artists' works at over 40,000 media spots throughout the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, and Fortaleza. 

We want Nouns to be a part of this activation. **Last year at NFT.Rio, the same exhibition setup led the Nouns 367 sale bought by Sanuxo for 113.22 ETH.**

### **PS:** Although what Eletromedia deliver in outreach is worth 400k USD, we've tailored a special nounish activation to just $25k.

#### Distribution of Eletromidia Presence in Sao Paulo

![](https://i.imgur.com/ydOnnUg.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/Q1BghWr.png)

Over 40,000 media spots throughout four big cities in Brazil, with a total population of **24,3 million people.**

### Nouns Lounge

The 25m² lounge will be comfortable and have an inviting atmosphere for attendees to gather. The space will feature puffs, chairs, and tables strategically arranged to showcase the websites, auctions, and content from some nounish projects: **Nouns**, **Foodnouns**, **Gnars**, **Lil Nouns**, and **Nouns BR**. The lounge is sure to be a must-visit destination for event-goers seeking the latest information and updates on Nouns and its innovative projects. A perfect place to onboard new people into the ecosystem.

The lounge will be inspired by the amazing work [Nouns Amigos](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos) is doing with the Nouns Fair.

![](https://i.imgur.com/M9w2gmk.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/eA7Fk2t.png)

The decision to locate the lounge right beside the speakers is a badass choice for several reasons.  It **puts Nouns at the heart of the event**, giving unrivaled **visibility** and **exposure**. Attendees will be drawn to the dynamic atmosphere around the speakers, and we will be perfectly positioned to engage with them as they move in and out of the area. Such special location will enable Nouns to build the brand and network. Three members of Nouns BR (JP, Guiriba and Debussy) will be there to welcome and onboard people who pass by the lounge. Additionally, we have planned some exciting magnet activations that are sure to grab the attention of passersby and draw them to our lounge.

![](https://i.imgur.com/BlLWPOD.png)


### Metaverse

NFT.Brasil is creating a metaverse in either Cryptovoxels and Spatial, designed by the talented metarchitect Fabio Ema. During the four-day IRL event, everything will be broadcasted there. After that, the NFT.Brasil team will keep it active for three months with online events, and the community will be able to use it as they see fit, forever. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/6cJJdRG.gif)

![](https://i.ibb.co/hZksJkY/ezgif-com-crop.gif)

Everything built for Cryptovoxels is a token. After the event, the Nouns building and avatars will be a legacy for the DAO. We are going to airdrop the building token in the wallet of all voters and also we will make the Nouns heads available as avatars, so anyone can be voxel-nounified to attend our metaverse agenda.

### Main Stage
![](https://i.imgur.com/dRT2vCC.jpg)


Aubtoshi is an exciting addition to the lineup of main stage speakers at the upcoming NFT.Brasil event. As a highly influential figure in the Nouns community, Aubtoshi's presentation is sure to be a highlight of the event. Her expertise and experience within the Nouns ecosystem will provide valuable insights for attendees, while her engaging speaking style and natural charisma are sure to captivate the audience. 

We'll also have a builders panel with Nouns BR members such as JP, Guiriba, Debussy, Vlad and others. They will tell  their stories within the ecosystem and invite the audience to join the Nouns community.

### NFT.Brasil Exhibition

NFT.Brasil is excited to announce that the upcoming exhibition will feature an exclusive art display by Nouns, alongside other highly respected collections such as Crypto Punks, and Doodles, BAYC and of course innovative navite brazilian collections. As one of the featured collections, Nouns will have a prominent position in the exhibition, offering visitors a chance to explore the ecosystem and engage with Nouns team. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/uVh9ccj.png)

**Building community, Every Day, Forever**

This event is not only a celebration of our achievements so far, but also a unique opportunity to showcase Nouns brand to millions of people across Brazil's largest cities for several weeks. As the biggest NFT event in the country, we have the chance to onboard thousands of new community members and take Nouns community in Brazil to the next level.

![Header](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52872169390_633a3ea920_c.jpg)

# tl;dr
Create the first Noun’s branded Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) that can be sold at almost all types of retail outlets to increase brand awareness. Nouns Wet Wipes will become a permanent item in the market after this initial investment of **USD 31,450** + **2 ETH** (up from USD 19,050 prop 265).

# Overview
Nouns Wet Wipes!! 
*It defends* (Against bacteria & viruses)!!
*It protects* (Against bacteria & viruses)!!
*It moisturizes* (Dry skin)!!
*Now it spreads* (The Nouns Brand) !!!

![B2](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52872018760_9b5f0a4406_c.jpg)

# Goals
1. Bringing Noun Wet Wipes to the masses, one pocket at a time!
2. A thoughtful token to be given out during events.
3. Inexpensive way of marketing the Noun’s brand to the public.
4. After initial investment into print drums, the wet wipes can continuously be produced at a low cost, increasing Brand Awareness perpetually.

# Details
Nothing beats the branding effect of a product that one carries around all day. Using these wipes will remind you of the Noun brand no matter where you are. Having these Nouns Wet Wipes sold near the checkout counters will definitely have an impact on brand awareness. With our custom eye catching wrapper, you just can’t miss it!

**In our first prop we left out a lot of information which we thought (at that time) wasn’t really important or just minor details. We apologize and we have added them into this prop.**


 **WHY WIPES?**
1. It's one of the common things you would carry around such as your keys, wallet, phone and sanitiser. A reminder of the Noun’s brand whenever you use it!
2. Economical to give away during events. Has utility so won’t be thrown away once you get home from the events.
3. Small enough to be easily displayed at the Checkout counters for maximum exposure.
4. Have enough space on the back of the item to incorporate a qr-code.
5. Something our team has experience working with!

**PACK SIZE 8’s Consideration**

***Why 8’s?***

1. This is the pack size that most will carry around. Unless you have a baby then a bigger pack size is required during diaper changes, but we are not doing that here… yet!
2. This is the pack size that takes up little space so it can be displayed at the checkout counter. 
3. Checkout counter sales are mostly ‘impulse’ buys and thus less price sensitive. As you move up the pack size, customers become more price sensitive. We have not reached scale production, therefore we cannot produce them at the lowest cost possible and thus need to target the less price sensitive range.
4. Lowest cost to be given out at events.

**Marketing Considerations**
Initially we weren’t planning on asking for a big marketing budget, however it seems to be one of the biggest reasons for rejection of prop265. 

**Our initial plan**
Sell into retail outlets at cost to proliferate. We know (from sales data, can’t share where from sorry >_<) that wet wipes **average sales** per month at checkout counters (or POS = Point of Sale as we call it) are around **30** packs per month. 
We have (110 cartons x 144 packs) 15,840 packs to sell off. 
- It will take 528 POS one month to sell off.
- Or 44 POS per year. 
- 44 POS = 22 retail outlets with a minimum of 2 POS each.

22 outlets is a very, very doable number just with our contacts alone, but it will take **ONE YEAR’s** time without any additional marketing funding. As some suggest we sell out in a shorter time frame, we shall therefore request a budget for marketing.

## New Marketing Initiative
**Goals**
- To sell all wet wipes in **ONE MONTH**. Based on healthcare retail data, a distribution chain of 200 outlets yields close to $150 million in total revenue per annum. Through our networks, deploying to 110 outlets on day one is possible. That way, our product holding period will be kept to a minimum (< 30 days). 
- To incentivise the outlets to let out prime retail shelf space, we developed an extra budget to “rent” their prime-est location, which is their point of sale (POS) aka cashier counter location to display our impulse purchase / daily necessity item. Making it easier to reach the customers.
- To boost the nounish branding and create a movement. Leveraging on the power of social media and the attractiveness of prizes.

**‘Sell Out’ in 1 Month**
Ideally, the wipes should be sold out within a month. With our current contacts, we should be able to ‘sell-in’ to 120 outlets nationwide but to further increase exposure, we will be renting *prime* space within the retail outlets.

**‘Renting’ Prime Space - Cost USD 6,000**
We will pay for prime POS display space at certain higher volume retail outlets to greatly increase exposure. 3-month’s display will only cost around USD 60 per POS space (thanks to its small size). We plan to ‘rent’ 100 prime POS display spaces which would cost USD 6,000.

***Example of prime retail space circled in red***

The moment we sell 80% of the wipes, we would make another batch. No cost to the DAO as it will be paid for from the sales of the first batch. This Prop is self sustaining and will continue to proliferate the Nouns Brand as long as we sell out and make new batches.

**Social Media Marketing - Cost USD 650 + 1 Carton of Wipes**
The main objective of the marketing campaigns is to reach the local and online population rapidly and ***encourage community participation to proliferate*** the nouns brand.

- Like & Share incentive: This campaign will be targeted at our retail partners, to share our content to their network, at a small incentive of $50 per quarter.  (Limited to 10 participating partners)
- Video creation incentive: We will run an online 10 second video format contest for everyone to submit, and we will pick a winner and reward them with a $50 prize. (One per month for 3 months)
- One carton of wipes will be set aside as the prizes for fun contests such as “Spot our Wipes in the Wild”, Fun Photo Submissions for customers who bought the wipes and uploaded in social media, etc.


**Design Considerations**
Again initially we weren't going to spend much on design since it was going to be a minimum viable product (MVP), design would just increase the initial cost as well as the running cost of the product. Our experience with wet wipes was that as long as it had an eye-catching color and the word ‘wipes’ was visible, it would sell at the POS counter. Packaging design was low on our list of priorities. A quick search on Amazon would reveal that the best selling wipes have a simple and minimalistic design.

![Original Wrapper](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52799159996_17b91fb903_c.jpg)
***Original wrapper design from Prop 265***

The original wrapper’s simple design (F) and single color was chosen with the costing of the print drum in mind. Every color we add to the wrapper increases the cost of the print drum significantly. 

However the DAO has spoken. A minimum standard of design must be followed as hot.4156.eth replied in the vote, and so we shall deliver. We shall set a high bar for these wipes and our future product development designs.

We will increase the number of colors for the design of the wrapper from 1 color in Prop 265 to 5 colors. We will be asking for funding for 5 colors, if however the chosen design has less than 5 colors, the extra funds would be sent back to the DAO treasury.

**Design Contest** *[Link](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/design-win-eth-nouns-wet-wipes-design-contest/4411/19)*
We have received input from some very helpful friends and the community that design cost may spiral out of control and that the results are still not guaranteed. So as to not go overboard with the design budget while retaining control over how much we pay, we have opted for a ‘Community Design Contest’ style of choosing and paying for the design. 

Payment will be fixed at **2 Eth** for the designs of the wipes. Since there are 4 components of the design that are required for wipes we think it’s fair for the winning design to receive 1.5 Eth while 0.5 Eth will be split among the top 2-5 designers.
The four parts of the design.

1. The wrapper
2. The flap
3. The box for holding 12 packs
4. The 3D mockup of the product

**The Contest Judges**
The judges of this contest would be the DAO itself so please choose which design you like best and let us know in the ‘Reason’ section when you vote. We will also take into account ‘Against’ votes if you did choose the design you like. 1 noun 1 vote. 

![Reason](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52872458095_478bc5e60f_z.jpg)

# Distribution to Nouns DAO Events
39 cartons of the wet wipes will be reserved for the events Nouns DAO has committed to attending (example: PROP 206) as well as future events that require merch to be given out. We will collect USD 5000 as shipping for this purpose, any leftovers will be returned to the DAO. If there’s a shortfall, the event organizers can pay the shipping to get it.

# Specifications
Each Pack will consist of 8 pcs of fragrance-free antibacterial wet wipe.

- Wipes size: 150mm x 140mm
- 12 packs in a Display Box 
- 12 boxes in a carton. Each carton contains 144 packs of wipes (8pcs)
- Minimum order quantity (MOQ) for each run is 150 cartons.
- Ingredients: Aqua, Propylene Glycol, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Polysorbate 20, Benzalkonium Chloride, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopheryl Acetate and a bit of Nounishness ⌐◨-◨

Wet wipes will be manufactured by our vetted local manufacturer in Malaysia which are certified GMP ISO 22716:2007 & QMS ISO 9001:2015


# Costing
1. Design cost ------------------------------------------------------- 2 ETH
2. Marketing cost
    a. ‘Rent’ prime POS for maximum exposure—----------------- USD 6,000
    b. Social media marketing —------------------------------------ USD 650
3. Print drum for nouns sticker design (one-time cost) ---------- USD 2,000
4. Custom wet wipes wrapper print mold (one-time cost) ------- USD 8,500
5. Display Box mold  -------------------------------------------- USD 1,500
6. 150 cartons of wet wipes (USD 52 per carton) ---------------- USD 7,800
7. Shipping to 20 events around the world (2 cartons each) ----- USD 5,000

**Total USD 31,450 + 2 ETH**

Print mold and drum prices increased from Prop 265 due to increased complexity and the number of colors of the designs. Printing costs also increased due to the increased colors thus increasing cost per carton from USD 49 to USD 52.

# Team Remuneration
We plan to set the Recommended Retail Price of below USD 1 while making it worthwhile for retail outlets to sell. Our team will take the net proceeds (after deducting warehousing, logistic and distribution costs) from the sales of the 110 cartons (40 cartons reserved for events) as remuneration. If we don’t sell, we don’t get paid! 

Future orders of this current design Noun wipes will cost significantly less as we already have the design and mold for the packaging. Should anyone require more Noun Wet Wipes, please contact us.

  ![](https://i.imgur.com/dhXeIlA.jpg)

**I. WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?**

These colorful 3” tall mini figures are meant to be a fun, stylish, low cost, and non-crypto-based entry point into the world of “NOUNs.” **Nounish Friends** are uniquely styled modular figures which are packed into mystery boxes, eye-catching counter displays positioned for museum shops, high end retail and lifestyle shops worldwide.

These unique designs represent a perfect evolution of the NOUN PFP to a beautiful and playful tactile art object. (Note: This series will feature 6 unique heads.  Additional characters will be added with future releases or collaborations with other projects.)

![](https://i.imgur.com/WGKqT1P.jpg)

**Why should Nouns fund these mini figures?**

These Nounish and high quality figures have a FUN modular play feature (interchangeable heads and glasses) that follows the unique building patterns of PFPs and creates infinite possibilities of fun and future extensions. The time is right to release a small colorful collection of figures like this to help promote NOUNS in all of their unique styles and interpretations. 

**A prop that assists future props:**

These mini figure designs are the type of product that will assist in any builders plans for proliferation. For example, David Horvath could use these in his activations in Japan and Korea, as well as NOTG and activations at Art Basel, ETHDenver & NFT London.

Combined with the existing Bigshot Noggles and enamel pins, these mini figures round out a vibrant capsule collection of Nouns merch with mass appeal. This collection will be particularly useful for builders who are planning IRL activations around the world, and easily accessible since all items in the capsule can ship from one centralized location.

These items are currently being solicited worldwide to museum shops and boutique retail locations.  The feedback has been very positive in regards to design, quality and pricing, but the buyers all need a ship date and review samples before making any commitment to an unknown brand.  

If the prop is passed we should have these available for distribution all over the world by the end of the year!
 
 ![](https://i.imgur.com/15hqZeX.jpg)

 **What's the plan post-production?** 

We have been in contact and actively soliciting retail/museum shop buyers, but they like to see something and order right away, so having production ready and a delivery schedule and final costs to present to them is imperative. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/h972zIu.jpg)

**Who is Bigshot and why are they a solid choice for collectibles?**

[BIGHSHOT TOYWORKS](https://www.bigshottoyworks.com/) has been making high end collectibles and art toys for over 25 years. We have worked with brands such as Nike, Microsoft and Blizzard, and artists like Mark Ryden, Jeff Soto, Steven Harrington and Futura 2000. Bigshot is the premier producer of collectibles like this. We are also behind [NOUNWORKS.WTF](https://www.nounworks.wtf/) and the iconic IRL Noggles.

**II. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT COSTS:**

**TOTAL ASK: $125,000**

·      $65,000 for production of 6,000 units (666 sets of toys)
·      $40,000 for project management, marketing, distribution
·      $20,000 for logistics and warehousing

Marketing & project management includes daily factory interactions, QC checks, sample reviews, and revisions, and all aspects of the project related to production. We also handle photography, press outreach, social media campaigns & engagement, client & partner onboarding & follow ups, warehousing, reasonable shipping for marketing opportunities worldwide as needed.


**PAYMENT SCHEDULE:** 
Upon passing of Prop, full amount will be sent to Gnosis safe in USDC. Payments to be sent to Bigshot in 3 milestones as follows:
• 40% upfront ($50,000 USD): pre-production & production deposit stages
• 30% on Milestone 1 ($37,500 USD): production balance, testing, sea shipping, duties, project management, marketing
• 30% on Milestone 2 ($37,500 USD): warehousing, logistics, marketing, proliferation management

**PAYMENT DETAILS**
• GNOSIS SAFE: USDC will be sent to a Gnosis Safe with the following signers:
Bigshot Klim, noun12.eth, sasqwash.eth
• The USDC will be held in a multisig and be released to Bigshot when Milestones are completed.
Multisig Adress: [0x7C9878E913d6AE8Fe8cf10783Ded77070b9cA68E](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7C9878E913d6AE8Fe8cf10783Ded77070b9cA68E)

**III. FUTURE STEPS**

Our 6000 physical toys will be utilized for both wholesale and retail sales for maximum reach and value. We believe that both are important aspect of this proof-of-concept model moving forward:

• 10% of the production will be allocated to community members and other Nouns initiatives like STUDIO1 activation in JP, Nouns Deli, Nouns Amigos, Nouns Africa and Art Basel Miami etc.(Shipping not included) 
• Units to be sold in shops at approx $16/toy, or approx $9 wholesale + shipping. A portion of the sales will be used to develop series 2 and will be put forth in a new proposal if the project is a success.
• Option for DAO allocated additional quantities from this edition at $9/unit
• Option to re-order at lower unit cost in a future run.
• Option to create unique colorways & revised single figure packaging for targeted events and activations with NOUNish events like ALPS Dao, Gnars Dao, NOUNS Amigos. NOTG and Potential POP-UP retail activations.
• We'd like to have some expedited product available for San Diego Comic-Con and David's activations in Japan to showcase and promote Nouns in key places.
• All of the items ship from a central location in the USA so the marketing and proliferation logistics are perfectly aligned.

PROJECT HISTORY:

[Prop 72](https://houseofnouns.wtf/nouns/proposals/72) was funded with 20ETH to take this project from initial idea, through countless iterations, to the current designs & prototypes. We have communicated updates weekly on the Discord here and have had many conversations on Discourse here, gathering feedback from over 50 comments to arrive at the final designs proposed in Prop 141. 
 
[Prop 141](https://houseofnouns.wtf/nouns/proposals/141) had some heated contentious voting at 78 for and 88 against with the majority of the for votes coming from individual holders.

Prop 141 has identified some pain points for the Nouners that are being addressed here to secure funding for production, marketing and distribution of these blind box minifigures to the museum shops, boutiques and art toy shops and galleries worldwide.

Thank you so much for your support, we look forward to getting this prop on chain, and to get these figures to the world in time for the holidays.

______________

*100 Nounish Things* is the latest video produced by **nounish ⌐◨-◨** as part of [proposal 143](https://nouns.wtf/vote/143) and will hopefully be the first of many available as NFTs.

The revenue from the mint will be split 50% to Nouns DAO and 50% to **nounish ⌐◨-◨** which will go to fund the **nounish ⌐◨-◨** [Prop House](https://prop.house/nounish) and share some revenue with Nate Mills (Sounds of Nouns), who wrote and performed the song.

Should the proposal pass, the edition will be minted with [Zora](https://zora.co/) and will be available at: [nounish.com/mint](nounish.com/mint/) after execution.

# TL;DR

In the last prop, we turned Pixel, a boutique production company of 10 world-class storytellers, into ""nounish"" - a full-time video production agency working on Nouns. 

We are only getting started and are seeking to continue funding nounish with the same budget ($969K). 

In Season 1 ([prop 143](https://nouns.wtf/vote/143)) we:
* published 92 minutes of high quality content
* got 3M views on our channels
* got 750K proliferated views via media on other channels
* 2.8X our followers
* published 80 new nounish gifs (and got 80 million views on giphy)
* many people are using our content to explain & onboard people to Nouns

Our mission is to produce content of the highest quality and play a key role in making Nouns a globally recognized and loved brand.

# Season 2

## Our Strategy
- Create **world-class, engaging & inspiring content** about Nouns and projects built with the brand.
- **Cater to the DAO’s video content needs**, e.g. from season 1:
  - [Mega explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa79nN4gMPs) on [nouns.wtf](https://nouns.wtf)
  - Danit Peleg’s [exhibition video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHauDW5BQQY)
  - [Nouns trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qECaDofv4yw) used for onboarding meetings (e.g. pitching brands) and [conferences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I85Q9YI1hcY)
  - [Rainbow Wallet Explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ1gS8gy8VQ) as part of using an eth wallet for Prop house onboarding
- **Encourage the distribution of our content**
	- **Open source** our content and make it extremely accessible and easy to use for remixing, sharing, and as raw material for other builders to create with.
	- **Leverage [Prop House](https://prop.house/nounish)** to get the top distribution ideas funded.
- **Be a leading voice of the Nouns brand**
	- Use the [@nounish](https://www.instagram.com/nounish/) [social media](https://twitter.com/nounish) to further build the Nouns brand by sharing on-brand, aspirational, content.
- **Mint our content**
	- To create a deeper connection with Nouns fans and to raise additional funds for our Prop House and for the DAO directly.

## Measuring our Success

Our leading principle is to create the highest quality possible content that makes the Nouns brand aspirational. 

Within this constraint, in season 2 we plan to measure our success with three metrics:

**1. Content Proliferation & Total Reach**
  -  Number of **proliferation instances** of our content is leveraged by others (e.g. KTLA using our content as b-roll)
  -  **Total Reach** - how many people saw our content
  	  -  **Why this metric?**  
  	  		-  This contains both our own reach, and reach by content proliferation.
  	  		-  This is a proxy for the usefulness & quality of our content.
  	  		-  It will lead us to making our content as accessible and re-usable as possible.
  -  **Season 2 Goals:** 
  		-  200 Instances of proliferation (vs. 50 in season 1)
  		-  5M Reach (vs. 3.75M in season 1)
  	
**2. Social Media Followers** 
  -  Total followers on @nounish social media accounts
  		-   **Why this metric?** 
  			-   This represents affinity with our content and is a proxy to our success as a ""voice of the Nouns brand""
-   **Season 2 Goals:**
		-   16,000 followers (2x)
**3. Minutes of content published**
* **Why this metric?**
	* During Season 1 we learned that having a constraint of the type of video we commit to make (e.g. short form or long form) is inefficient
	* We think our high quality content minutes should be fungible and that we should be able to choose the type of content that best fits the story.
	* This is an output metric and not an outcome metric, but we think it's important for the DAO to get a sense of what quantity of high quality content can be expected from this prop. 
* **Season 2 Goals:** 
	* 90 minutes of high quality videos delivered (~same as season 1)


## Content Pipeline for Season 2

**Writing**
* Nouns funding Crypto Infra 
* Agora, Prop House, etc.    
* Nouns is a radical governance experiment
	* Covering from the beginning of the DAO and climaxing at the DAO Split implementation
* What Makes a Nouner Tick?
    * Include many Nouners vision for the DAO, what makes a good proposal to them etc.
* Nouns Deli
 
**Filming**
* Nouns Esports 
* Xanadu

**Post production**
* Danit Peleg
* Rose Parade


## Prop House

Investing in high quality content is super valuable for the DAO, but we also should tap into the power of decentralization to proliferate our content as well. 

The [first Prop House Round](https://prop.house/nounish/growth-hacking-nounish-content) is live and we will be running more of these, both open and targeted rounds. 

![](https://imgur.com/efLuwFl.png)


## Open Sourcing our Content

As part of our effort to lean into content proliferation, we will be working on making our content more accessible and easy to use. 

Similar to how nounish gifs are so easy to use on social media, we want our video content to be as accessible and easy to remix and reuse by anyone. 

It will be searchable with tags and key terms, like a stock photo website but for Nouns media and all of it is CC0.


![](https://imgur.com/U8qxFQ8.png)



## Minting

We have started minting our work, to create a deeper connection with our content. The funds will be split between Nouns DAO and our distribution fund so that we can use the funds for further proliferation.

# Deep Dive

## Learnings - a retrospective on our last prop

We want to share our challenges and learnings during season 1 to augment the conversation in the DAO and highlight opportunities for other teams. 

Our two top challenges, which we dealt with throughout season 1 are:

1. **Explaining Nouns is very hard**
	* Nouns is a very layered topic that is hard to explain succinctly.
	* If it's too simplified, it becomes boring and doesn't make any sense.
	* Breaking it into parts is also challenging because Nouns makes sense only as one package.
	* Different audiences and different contexts require different explanations.
	* **Learnings:**
		* Continue spending a lot of cycles experimenting with different ways and formats to explain Nouns.
		* Continue iterating on messaging and observing what resonates.

2. **Figuring out our target audience is challenging** 
	* Initially we tried to target potential builders as our audience, but we felt that it wasn't capturing the opportunity of getting more nouners and fans on board. 
	* Halfway through season 1 we landed on the thesis that we are looking to reach early adopters of crypto and new tech who will find the Nouns experiment appealing. 
	* We still don't know exactly who  Nouns resonate with most and who we should target.
		* We are missing data on the funnel and believe the DAO should spend more resources on figuring this out systematically.
	* We grappled a lot with the question of how we get people to **care** about the story of Nouns and the things being built on it and become fans.
	* **Learnings:**
		* **We need more funnel data** - we would love to see a team propose a data project for Nouns to:
			* Understand **who are the builders, nouners, and fans** of the brand
			* Map out the ""customer journey"" of each of the audience segments identified
		* We are **open sourcing our content** to let more parallel experiments on different audiences, to be run by more teams 
		* In our opinion, proposals need to focus on making people care about Nouns
			* Our belief is that public good funding is the easiest shortcut to make people care about Nouns.

Additional challenges & learnings: 



* **We didn't get enough input and feedback from Nouners from across the DAO**
	* We received feedback that during season 1 we didn't cover the breadth of what Nouns funds - and focused on mostly creative props. 
	* We want to represent and cater to various parts of the DAO, and we need to do a better job getting inputs from Nouners with varied visions for what the DAO is.
	* We want our content to be neutral and do the best job to represent as much as possible from various points of view in the DAO.
	* **In Season 2:**
		* We will consult various DAO members to hear what content they think would be powerful and useful, as well as represent their varied vision for the DAO.
		* We will take our lead from the Tech Pod's approach to coming to the DAO with a slate update and getting a read on what the DAO wants to see and prioritising it. 




* **The logistics of proposals is hard to manage**
	* We have limited control over the stories that we are reporting about, and that can hurt our content pipeline.
	* With many props, the timelines are in flux and it's difficult to plan ahead.
	* **Learnings:**
		* We focused more on making original content such as the Mega Explainer & 100 nounish things (*a video to be published soon, before the prop goes on chain*)
		* We created a Shorts format that is not dependent on specific props
		* [Creative Absurd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oec19SUIyb8) focused on interviews and stories that are not dependent on delivery timing
* **Over optimization around fast growth diminishes brand building** 
	* When we focus too intently and on viral thumbnails & titles, it makes the brand cheaper
	* **Learning:**
		* We never want to get in a race to the bottom on virality.
		* We always want to be top of class in terms of our content, to maintain the Nouns brand as a premium brand.
		* We open source our content to let others also experiment with virality with less risk to the brand.

* **Short form vs Long form and generally video formats** 
	* Committing to a discrete number of videos, whether short or long, was a mistake:
		* Instead of thinking about how to maximize on content, we oftentimes focused too much on delivery formats and cadence.
		* We want to be free to experiment with more variations in lengths, format, style, and audiences.
	* **Learnings:**
		* We are shifting to a minutes-published goal and not a specific number of videos released.
		* We are shifting to a more open and experimental approach to what kind of videos we ship in terms of their content and story.

* **It takes time to build momentum**
	* Ramping up internal momentum and onboarding our entire team took longer than expected - Nouns are hard to explain and to understand
	*  Building rapport and trust with builders and getting great content and input from them takes time.
	*  **Learnings**
		*  We believe that the DAO should hire world-class talent for long-term contracts to amortize the fixed cost of onboarding and momentum building



# Stats

## 3 million @nounish social media views

* Out of 3M views, two videos stand out as outliers and got much more views than the rest:
	* [Taki from Nouns esports](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CreCH1zAR5Z/) - 500K on instagram
	* [Praca XV](https://www.instagram.com/reel/ClH3tXAgdxQ/) - 1.1M on instagram
	* Why?
		* **Traction with communities** (extreme sports, skateboarding, rio skate culture, rio nft culture, esports, fans of taki)
		* **Boosting our organic winners** with a few hundred dollars of paid media (it only works well if you have good PMF with the videos)

### TLDR;
- Funding [SCG Group](https://scg.red), a digital agency with the goal to empower digital Chinese communities to learn about and actively contribute to the broader Nouns ecosystem.
- Multi-platform (RED, Douyin, Weibo) Social Media Campaign for Nouns DAO in China
- 5+ posts per week on each of the 3 platforms focusing on translation and remixing of images & short-form videos from other platforms
- Oni traveling to China offering guidance and support to the local team, sourcing content and ensuring that our marketing endeavors remain nounish and in line with the global nouns community.
- 63 ETH streamed over 6 month period


**Long Term Vision**: Building a meaningful and long-lasting Nounish community in China poses a challenging yet exciting opportunity for the DAO. Our goal is to make Nouns a highly recognizable brand among Chinese-speaking individuals and to inspire ambitious builders within this community to engage with the Protocol.

**Objectives**:
1. Introduce Nouns DAO to Chinese-speaking individuals interested in web3, serving as their gateway to the space.
2. Offer a comprehensive understanding of Nouns to Chinese-speaking individuals curious about its concept.
3. Facilitate the integration of new Chinese builders, inspiring and connecting them with existing builders to generate ambitious and impactful proposals.
4. Highlight funded projects and empower the Chinese community to share our content and narrative within their own networks.
5. Empower builders to leverage our content for seamless interactions with Chinese brands and non-crypto organizations.

**Opportunity:**
As the world’s most populous country, boasting over 1.4 billion people, China offers a vast potential market for Nouns. The nation’s more than 1 billion active internet users and over 1.2 billion mobile phone users further amplify the tremendous opportunities available.

We feel distribution of existing content is a huge opportunity within the DAO. Our ambition is to continue to proliferate the meme throughout this expansive territory. The recent decision by the DAO to fund a series of activations across China has provided the perfect springboard for our efforts. We intend to build on this momentum by launching a comprehensive, multi-platform social media campaign, leveraging local marketing expertise to cultivate a significant and enduring Nounish community within the country.

![CN Digital Population](https://i.imgur.com/F4MEB9h.png)

**Strategy:**
It is crucial to acknowledge that China’s digital landscape is distinctly unique, as most Chinese internet users lack access to western online content. The nation boasts various platforms and services exclusive to its market. We understand that customizing our marketing and outreach initiatives to cater different segments of the Chinese market is vital. As such, we aim to meticulously consider cultural subtleties, regulations, preferences, and values of Chinese internet users in order to adapt our strategy effectively.

Given the vast expanse of China and the diverse demographics that Nouns can resonate with, it is essential to involve numerous content creators and create tailored content streams for this region. To accomplish this, Oni intends to visit China during the pilot phase, collaborating directly with SCG's team on the ground and immersing himself in the local culture and web3/art communities. We are confident that our multi-platform strategy, combined with in-depth marketing knowledge of the market, will enable us to successfully attain this objective.

## SCG Group
Our expertise lies in helping brands penetrate the Chinese market and expand their footprint. With more than a decade of experience introducing international brands and artists to China, we leverage our profound understanding of both Chinese and Western cultures, as well as slang and trends, to drive consistent and organic growth. To date, we have amassed over 27 million followers for Western brands and artists in China.

At SCG Group, we meticulously select our partners, much like how the Nouns community carefully reviews and votes for each prop. This is mainly due to the significant amount of human resources we invest in tailoring plans for each project.

Nevertheless, Nouns immediately captured our attention due to its unique blend of technology, branding, and collective community experimentation. We admire the art, the permissionless approach to IP, and we aspire to play a pivotal role in facilitating China’s integration into the global Nouns community.

**Jonas Blue**
![Jonas Blue1](https://i.imgur.com/z3lRzef.png)

To help artists break through and increase their visibility in China, SCG always takes the initiative to carefully curate and recreate content that specifically caters to the Chinese audience's preferences.

SCG built Jonas Blue's digital profile in China from scratch. One of the earliest posts we made was a live clip of his song ""By Your Side,"" which garnered an impressive 2.1M streams, 154,000 likes, 2,618 comments, and 1,787 reposts organically. In just one month, he gained over 40,000 followers on his Chinese social media accounts.

![Jonas Blue2](https://i.imgur.com/92eH7TN.png)

![Jonas Blue3](https://i.imgur.com/ZttoJjE.png)

After collaborating with SCG for about 6 months, there has been a surge in traffic and heightened artist awareness for Jonas Blue in China. As a result, Chinese people have taken an interest in Jonas Blue and his work. Many content creators and influencers on social media platforms have spontaneously started recording and posting videos using his other songs, which has led to a couple of his other songs besides “By Your Side” going viral in China.

For example, more than 4,000 Douyin users have joined the ""Mama Challenge"" initiated by SCG under Jonas Blue's accounts. Each post has received an average of over 100,000 likes and 3,000 comments. The viral nature of this challenge has further promoted Jonas Blue's music and increased his reach in China.

**Salvatore Ganacci**
![Salvatore1](https://i.imgur.com/tOuAagj.png)

To build the profile of Salvatore Ganacci, a renowned Swedish artist with a distinctive, unconventional brand, in the Chinese market, we have undertaken a comprehensive effort to adapt and repurpose his contents to suit the local audience's sensibilities.

Our approach has yielded excellent results, after reviewing his existing content we built the 3 videos listed above amassing a total of 25.3 million streams, 896,000 likes, and 55,432 comments. In a mere 3 months, his follower count has soared from 10,000 to an impressive 150,000 (15x).

291,Nouns Stream Proposal: Payments infrastructure public good by Nouns DAO,"# Nouns Stream Proposal: Payments infrastructure public good by Nouns DAO

# tl;dr

[Nouns Stream](https://www.nouns.stream) is a public good for payments across Noun-ish DAOs and beyond. It is an open-source, free, permission-less protocol that enables **Phased (milestone-based) or Periodic (recurring)** **payments**. This public good can support various payment modes, including peer-to-peer, DAO-to-DAO, community rounds, and grants without complex setup, shadow tokens, or intermediary protocol fees.

Nouns Stream does more than further the Nouns’ visual brand/meme; it helps push the ecosystem forward with easy-to-use public goods. This protocol has already been [audited by 0xMacro](https://0xmacro.com/library/audits/nouns-stream-1.html) and deployed across Ethereum ([Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB13Afc4f39942b885A00A60A02295016BF82d447#code), [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05#code)), Arbitrum ([Mainnet](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05), Goerli), Optimism ([Mainnet](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05), Goerli), Polygon ([Mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05), [Mumbai](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05)) and Base ([Goerli](https://goerli.basescan.org/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05)).

The protocol developers, who are also Nouns’ holders, are asking for a retroactive grant of **16 eth** to cover the cost of the audit (US$25,000 ie ~14 eth) and deployment (US$5,000 ie ~2 eth).

![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/9g5l0ZE.png)

# Problem

Nouns and Noun-ish DAOs have no recourse or control over outgoing funds due to a successful proposal. If a team fails to deliver or meet certain milestones, the community cannot vote to recall the remaining funds.

Moreover, contributors to longer-running, phased projects need more certainty. Today they are forced to make a single, big ask for funding or create multiple proposals over the life of their project to secure continued funding. Unfortunately, such uncertainty doesn’t help set up ambitious developers, artists, and creators for success.

Lastly, as the community evolves, it may pay specific contributors— e.g., IRL Events Coordinator — a fixed amount per quarter, paid bi-weekly.

Within the community, we have seen a healthy debate between funding experiments to further the meme while keeping treasury spending in check. Tooling like Nouns Stream helps balance where milestone-based payments can commit to experiments and revert (via Proposal) if a project is not delivering the promised objectives.

# Proposal

The Nouns Stream protocol is open-source, free, and permissionless. It allows anyone to set up an escrow account that is funded with funds later disbursed via one of two modes:

1. Phased (i.e., milestone-based)
2. Periodic (i.e., regular intervals)

To further clarify and formally define:

1. **Phased:** these are milestone-based payments where the funds are set up to be disbursed in predefined amounts on fixed dates. The dates and amounts for each milestone are set up during contract deployment. Configuring payment amounts on a milestone basis allows for unique cases requiring larger upfront payments to bootstrap projects. For example, a proposal for 75 eth might be broken into four parts over some fixed dates like:
    1. 04-10-2023: 35 eth
    2. 04-20-2023: 5 eth
    3. 04-30-2023: 15 eth
    4. 05-15-2023: 20 eth
2. **Periodic:** these are recurring payouts at fixed intervals defined in days or weeks. For example, a proposal could be set up to pay a community contributor 24 eth for the next three months (12 weeks) at two-week intervals, i.e., they will get paid 4 eth every two weeks from the escrow.

The Controller/Sender (e.g. Nouns Governor’s Contract in the case of Nouns DAO) is the only party that can cancel the escrow and recalls funds. The Receiver can’t withdraw funds before said strike dates. Such controls allow the community to create follow-up proposals and recall funds if a project is not believed to deliver on its promise long-term.

The protocol has a tipping mechanism where payments will be pushed to the receiving address if the payout is set up with a tip incentive. This avoids the need for Receiver to claim/withdraw funds. If no tip percentage is defined during contract deployment, the Receiver has to withdraw funds as they become available manually. Today, the tips are hard-coded to go to a fixed address. The developers will release an update within a few weeks where anyone who helps run these transactions can trigger transactions and earn tips.

With predictable payout timelines, Nouns Square can hold regular Demo Day sessions for projects to share progress against milestones 👀

Some previous proposals that could’ve directly benefited from the proposed payment infrastructure include:

- [Fund design, engineering, and community contributors](https://nouns.wtf/vote/17)
- [Prop House Protocol: Public Infrastructure by Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105)
- [Nounish Dataverse, open source data](https://nouns.wtf/vote/240)
- [Nouns Deli Melbourne: Piloting a Nounish Franchise Model](https://nouns.wtf/vote/254)

Nouns Stream distinguishes from existing protocols such as Juicebox and Sablier through focused features, better user experience and Nounish visual branding:

1. It is visually propagating the Nouns meme
2. Providing a point-and-click user experience that any proposer can use to set up an escrow
3. Leverages CREATE2 opcode to provide future contract address, thus eliminating the need to pre-emptively deploy contracts or setup streams before Proposal has passed
4. Phased payment unlocks on pre-determined milestone dates
5. Capability to setup different payment amount for each phase within project
6. Zero fees, forever, and low gas
7. No secondary token to swap and manage
8. Sender/Controller fully controls the funds, i.e., DAO or multi-sig, who adds funds to the deployed contract

# Deliverables & Ask

Everything has been built as open source and under the GPL license. The deliverables include a developer (React) SDK, allowing other developers to under this infrastructure within their applications. In addition, 0xMacro has [audited](https://0xmacro.com/library/audits/nouns-stream-1.html) the project.

**The total ask for this project is 16 eth.**

This funding will help the developers (retroactively) cover:

- cost of the audit completed by 0xMacro (US$25,000 ie ~14 eth)
- cost of contract deployment across all networks (US$5,000 ie ~2 eth)

In the future, the developers want to extend Nouns Build and add these payout options natively (via pull request) to the project. However, this Proposal doesn’t ask for funding for any such future development:

292,Refill voteRefund balance,"# Refill voteRefund balance

The voteRefund function is important for the health and integrity of the DAO as it helps maintain a diverse voter base and combat voter apathy.

The contract was initially funded ~7 months ago with 12 eth. At time of writing ~0.8eth remains, which implies an ongoing cost to the DAO of 1.6 eth per month.

As the DAO continues to grow, with more voters and more proposals, it is likely that the rate at which the voteRefund balance is depleted will also increase.

I propose we top up the contract with another 15 eth.


---

**Recap of how this feature works:**
- Vote with Gas Refund allow Nouners and delegates to vote and receive a gas refund.
- Refunds are subject to certain constraints:
    - Gas base fee is capped at 200 gwei.
    - Gas priority fee is capped at 2 gwei.
    - Total gas is capped at 200K, supporting voting reason text up to roughly 9,190 characters.
    - If the contract’s balance is insufficient, voter will receive a partial refund.
- This feature requires the DAO to maintain the DAO contract’s ETH balance, which should be done via periodic ETH transfer proposals from the treasury to the DAO contract (this proposal performs the first funding).
- The DAO can choose to withdraw refund ETH back into the treasury at any time via a proposal.

293,Increase Proposal Supply,"# Increase Proposal Supply

This proposal aims to increase the supply of proposals by **reducing the proposal threshold to 9bps**. Success of this proposal means only 1 Noun is required to submit a proposal to the DAO until Noun 1111. This is approximately ~367 days^.

By increasing the proposal supply, we should expect an overall rise in the number of high-quality proposals that receive funding. While this may also lead to a higher number of rejected or low-quality proposals, recent voter turnout and controls like Dynamic Quorum sufficiently mitigate these concerns. Ultimately, more funded proposals would result in a greater influx of contributors, projects, attention, and as a result further overall expansion of Nouns as an organization and meme.

It may also be the case that the net value of an individual Noun should see an increase, given the improved governance right of having the ability to propose to the DAO without the additional coordination cost or acquisition cost of another Noun.

By increasing the proposal threshold, we should expect an overall reduction in the number of proposals submitted. While this may lead to a lower number of submitted proposals, widespread use of delegation will allow the highest quality proposals to be submitted, and sufficiently mitigate these concerns. An additional benefit is a lower risk of voter fatigue.

## Re-submission disclaimer

The NounsBR team remains committed to delivering an exceptional encounter with NFT.Brasil. To achieve this, we have made adaptations to Proposal 285 based on two key considerations:

 - Addressing community requests: We have carefully taken into account the feedback and incorporated changes accordingly.

 - Working within time constraints: We have evaluated what is feasible within the given timeframe and made adjustments.

#### Key Changes and Focus Areas:

 - We already sent the sponsors to the first wave of Eletromidia 00H activation. We still have time to phase 2 and 3 of this activation described in [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JMDP9eevh8a1D7aK3_ZCxQjjTjs2rFufTX09WOiWkt4/edit?usp=sharing).
That includes 78 airport screens, 41 commercial buildings spots with 405 screens and more. Over 1 million impressions, we expect great outcomes from this activation)   

 - Lower the Metaverse Activation: After considering community feedback, we have decided to lower the Metaverse Activation from the proposal.*

 -  Scaling down the lounge to a booth: In response to community feedback on the sponsorship price, we have transformed the lounge into a booth. Additionally, we have adjusted the sponsorship package to align with the revised offering.**

 - Collaboration with Aubtoshi for merchandise: Instead of producing our own merchandise, we have decided to collaborate with Aubtoshis and feature their pre-made merchandise.

By incorporating these changes the proposal addresses community's concerns while still delivering an extraordinary event experience fulfilling the Nouns community expectations. 

**OBS***:Nouns building token, Noggles and Some 3D avatars will be airdroped to the community, its done anyways we gotta use it :) 

**OBS****: Instead of having 3 people taking care of the Lounge we are going to create booth shifts and also reduce the costs with personal

## TL:DR 

Nouns leads the NFT movement in Brazil thanks to its community, but we are just getting started. We are proposing a huge Sao Paulo city takeover starting in NFT.Brasil event.

Our goal is to achieve a massive and innovative onboarding experience for all attendees, and to do so, we will be present in five strategic areas throughout the event journey. These include the NFT Exhibition, Speaker Sessions, Booth, Metaverse, and Street Gallery ([Eletromedia](https://eletromidia.com.br/) OOH advertising). 

![](https://i.imgur.com/3CH4aRq.png)

NFT.Brasil is a pioneering conference celebrating the cutting-edge advancements and possibilities of the NFT world that is set to take place in Sao Paulo city, **Brazil on June 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, 2023.**

NFT.Brasil is performed by the same organizers of [NFT.Rio](https://nftrio.io/), Nouns Community builders (the same people behind Proposals [#142](https://nouns.wtf/vote/142), [#118](https://nouns.wtf/vote/118)   [#98](https://nouns.wtf/vote/98)) in partnership with [MAAC Hub](https://www.instagram.com/maac.hub/).

We want to bring Nouns to NFT.Brasil. The event is expected to attract over 30,000 individuals. The venue is the iconic Bienal, which is a true masterpiece of contemporary design, and is a premier cultural destination in Brazil.

## The Brazilian Genesis

## What is NFT.Brasil?

Get ready to witness an exciting fusion of art, technology, business, networking and innovation at NFT.Brasil, a pioneering conference that is all set to take place at Bienal, an iconic venue in heart of Sao Paulo. The event promises to be a one-of-a-kind experience that brings together digital artists, web3 builders, art enthusiasts, business leaders from outside Web3 to learn and connect new opportunities.

![](https://i.imgur.com/WS14MiW.gif)

The mockup video gives you a sneak peek of what's to come: [click here to watch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCPjVRjLDA)

Bienal was designed by the legendary Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and was first opened in 1951 to host the São Paulo Art Bienal, which is one of the world's most prestigious art exhibitions. 

Hosting NFT.Brasil conference at the Bienal is a jump from traditional events and a testament to the venue's reputation as a premier cultural destination, and it promises to be an ideal setting for the fusion of art and technology that is at the heart of the NFT movement.

![](https://i.imgur.com/0gS9Ksp.jpg)

The event is June 2nd, 3rd, and 4th and will be divided into two areas. The NFT exhibition will showcase Brazilian and international artists, collections, projects, and DAOs. The second area will host talks and lectures, bringing the community together to discuss the technology and its impact on our present and future. With a combination of NFT art exhibitions and speaker sessions, the event expects to attract over 30,000 individuals seeking knowledge, connections, and business opportunities in the field. São Paulo is one of the largest and most vibrant cities in the world, making it the perfect backdrop for this exciting event. 

## What does Nouns gets by funding this proposal?

Besides being a huge celebration of the Nouns community in Brazil and what we've been building for 9 months after NFT.Rio, and also being a great chance to bring new people on board, Nouns DAO will get:

### Open-air NFT exhibition - [Eletromedia](https://eletromidia.com.br/)

For 20 days, NFT.Brasil will host the largest open-air NFT exhibition in the world. In partnership with Eletromedia, Brazil's leading Out of Home media company, NFT.Brasil will showcase artists' works  throughout the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, and Fortaleza. 

We want Nouns to be a part of this activation. **Last year at NFT.Rio, the OOH media led the Nouns 367 sale bought by Sanuxo for 113.22 ETH.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/HrGlQ5F.jpg)

The proposed package for this proposal aims 13 days of insertions in strategic points over the city of São Paulo, described as follows:

### Metaverse (We kept this here cause we are still doing metaverse stuff and what is done will not be undone) 

NFT.Brasil is created a metaverse in either Cryptovoxels and Spatial, designed by the talented metarchitect Fabio Ema. During the four-day IRL event, everything will be broadcasted there. After that, the NFT.Brasil team will keep it active for three months with online events, and the community will be able to use it as they see fit, forever.

### Main Stage
![](https://i.imgur.com/dRT2vCC.jpg)


Aubtoshi is an exciting addition to the lineup of main stage speakers at the upcoming NFT.Brasil event. As a highly influential figure in the Nouns community, Aubtoshi's presentation is sure to be a highlight of the event. Her expertise and experience within the Nouns ecosystem will provide valuable insights for attendees, while her engaging speaking style and natural charisma are sure to captivate the audience. 

We'll also have a builders panel with Nouns BR members such as JP, Guiriba, Debussy, Vlad and others. They will tell  their stories within the ecosystem and invite the audience to join the Nouns community.

### NFT.Brasil Exhibition

NFT.Brasil is excited to announce that the upcoming exhibition will feature an exclusive art display by Nouns, alongside other highly respected collections such as Crypto Punks, Doodles and of course innovative navite brazilian collections. As one of the featured collections, Nouns will have a prominent position in the exhibition, offering visitors a chance to explore the ecosystem and engage with Nouns team. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/uVh9ccj.png)

**Building community, Every Day, Forever**

This event is not only a celebration of our achievements so far, but also a unique opportunity to showcase Nouns brand to millions of people across Brazil's largest cities for several weeks. As the biggest NFT event in the country, we have the chance to onboard thousands of new community members and take Nouns community in Brazil to the next level.

NFT.Brasil is going to bring more than 5,000 students from public schools with a unique 3-day opportunity to explore the world of digital art. This event not only offers a chance to appreciate the beauty of this art form but also serves as a platform for driving social impact and fostering community development. Alongside Skate Cuida, G10 Favelas, a group of  social impact leaders and entrepreneurs from the Favelas, plays a vital role in this initiative.

## TL;DR 📝

- The Nouns Running Club aims to counter the partying stereotype of crypto events by focusing on fun, fitness, and FRENship.
- The club welcomes runners of all skill levels; no NFTs are required 🙌.
- The club will host runs at crypto conferences and local chapter weekly runs 🌍.
- The club's current local chapters span eight countries 🇺🇸🇭🇰🇲🇾🇩🇴🇰🇷🇹🇼🇯🇵🇨🇦.
- **The proposed budget: $52,650.** This supports 11 city chapters (8 existing, 3 new) and 2 major conference runs (EthCC 🇫🇷 + DevConnect 🇹🇷) for the next 6 months.

## Introduction 🚀


Established in April 2023, the Nouns Running Club is on a mission to transform the social layer surrounding Nouns and the wider crypto industry.

Shifting away from the partying stereotypes, our club aligns with the Nouns ecosystem's values, fostering connections through running and supporting local communities.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ld4THBp.jpg)

## Motivation 💡

The Nouns Running Club was born out of a desire to challenge the prevailing partying stereotype of crypto events. We recognized the need to start a movement that promotes fun, fitness, and FRENship while showcasing the positive aspects of Nouns.

Our long-term vision includes hosting a major road marathon with Nouns as the title sponsor and host, aiming to create a lasting impact on the industry's perception and proliferation.

## Accomplishments So Far 🏅

Since its inception in April 2023, the Nouns Running Club has made remarkable strides in achieving its goals of promoting physical fitness, community growth, and social responsibility. Here are some of our key accomplishments:

- Grown to over 120 members on Telegram, with more joining every week 📈.
- Over a thousand cumulative KMs run by members.
- Established weekly run leaders in 8 different cities around the world (see below), providing members with the opportunity to participate in regular group runs 🌏.
- Developed a strong brand identity, including a custom t-shirt, a dedicated Telegram chat, and a set of Telegram sticker packs created by [@MochiNFT](https://twitter.com/MochiNFT) on the recommendation of [@0xMaki](https://twitter.com/0xmaki).

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ3mJNzSh.png)

These accomplishments demonstrate the commitment and dedication of the Nouns Running Club. With the support of the wider Nouns DAO community, we aim to continue to grow and make an even greater impact.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk6fJVzBh.png)

## Proliferation 📈

How does the Nouns Running Club promote proliferation of Nouns and Nounish-ness?

One of the major hurdles 🚧 to proliferation is the difficulty of introducing Nouns to people outside of crypto. However, we can jump over that hurdle by welcoming anyone, regardless of running ability, promoting the Nounish values of collaboration, diversity, and open participation.

You don't even need to hold NFTs or know what crypto is. If you can move from point A to B, you're invited! 🏃💨

Wearing our custom Nouns Running Club gear, we act as moving billboards, promoting Nouns to onlookers and fellow runners. Our events create opportunities for people to interact with the Nouns community in a fun, informal, and healthy context.

Our goal is to reshape the social layer and showcase the positivity of Nouns to a wider audience.

## Activities 🏃‍♀️

The Nouns Running Club will engage in two types of activities: Special Event Runs at Crypto Conferences and Local Chapter Weekly Runs. Both are key to our plan for growth and proliferation.

These are usually ~5km runs targeted towards beginners to run at a leisurely pace. We have a culture of ""No one left behind!"", which means we will always ensure that everyone is taken care of regardless of their pace.

In fact, it's in our motto:

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryEWrNzr2.png)

### Special Event Runs at Crypto Conferences 🎟️

By doing special runs as a side-event to conferences, we can penetrate a much bigger audience as people from around the world fly in to attend these conferences. This has been proven by our genesis event in ETHGlobal Tokyo, which spawned the Tokyo, Taipei, Hong Kong, and Seoul chapters. See testimonials below!

#### EthCC (Paris 🇫🇷) - July 17, 2023

EthCC is the largest annual Ethereum event in Europe. Not only that, it is also a non-profit event by the local Ethereum community. Very Nounish! Owing to the fact that we do not currently have any local chapters in Europe, we hope this activation will allow us to grow some local chapters in the European region.

#### DevConnect (Istanbul 🇹🇷) - November 13, 2023

Since DevCon has been postponed, this will be the premier Ethereum event of the year. The location of Istanbul will also attract many attendees from all over Europe, and we believe that this will help bootstrap multiple European chapters as well.

### Local Chapter Weekly Runs 🌍

Each local chapter has its own run leaders who organize and guide weekly runs. These leaders serve as ambassadors of Nounish-ness in their respective localities, promoting the values of Nouns DAO and encouraging more people to join the ecosystem.

By integrating physical fitness with community engagement, we aim to create a unique, fun, and rewarding experience for all members of the community.

Currently, we have local chapters in the following cities:

- Denver 🇺🇸 led by [@jp4g_](https://twitter.com/jp4g_)
- Hong Kong 🇭🇰 led by [@Natalielpy](https://twitter.com/Natalielpy)
- Kuala Lumpur 🇲🇾 led by [@motypes](https://twitter.com/motypes)
- Santo Domingo 🇩🇴 led by [@necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas)
- Seoul 🇰🇷 led by [@colorchipeth](https://twitter.com/colorchipeth)
- Taipei 🇹🇼 led by [@AkiraWuc](https://twitter.com/AkiraWuc)
- Tokyo 🇯🇵 led by [@shutollen](https://twitter.com/shutollen)
- Vancouver 🇨🇦 led by [@adrianmcli](https://twitter.com/adrianmcli)

With the help of this proposal, we hope to expand to at least three more cities within the next 6 months, with a particular focus in the European region.

## Testimonials 💬

> ""During my time at ETH Tokyo, I attended numerous informative side events, all following a similar format of renting out a nice cafe or club, promoting networking, and featuring a speaker. Among them, ""Let's run together and create a healthy crypto culture!💪"" caught my attention due to my passion for exercise, so I immediately signed up. It proved to be a refreshing and much-needed event. Running amidst the beautiful Tokyo scenery, I bonded with fellow crypto industry acquaintances who shared a similar interest in fitness, allowing me to make friends quickly. Additionally, receiving a delightful printed t-shirt added to my happiness. Recognizing that I couldn't continue this running event upon returning to Seoul, I took the initiative to become the lead organizer and gather individuals for running sessions in my city.""

— [@colorchipeth](https://twitter.com/colorchipeth), Seoul Chapter Leader, Nouns Running Club

> ""In the beginning of my first 5k run with Nouns Running Club, I was nervous because everyone else seemed to be much more experienced in running, but this feeling completely went away as the founder of the club, Adrian, stayed back and kept pace with me all the time. 
> 
> But what made me even more touched is what happened next. As we approached the 4km mark, the rest of the group, who had already completed the run, turned back and rejoined us. We were both very surprised and asked them why they came back. Akira, our Taipei Club leader, replied us with a warm smile, ""Of course we come back, we are a club."" And another member (Jack, Denver chapter leader) also smiled and said to us ""No one left behind."" In the end, we finished our 5k together as a united team. 
> 
> Thanks to this experience and the whole group, I started to like running and run with the club whenever I have time. And I hope that more people could experience what I have experienced. This club is not only about running, it's also about togetherness, care, and the pure kindness between people.""

## **2. Past Proposal Summary**

![](https://i.imgur.com/HRZT5II.jpg)

![](https://i.imgur.com/FKYUjfp.jpg)

### **Prop 176 Recap**

On December 3rd, we were [funded](https://nouns.wtf/vote/176) of 32.28 ETH ($42K) to build an archive center which stores & display all media contents of Nouns DAO's projects & artworks and all the memes proliferations. It serves as the central repository for storing and displaying all data such as ;

* proposal progress images/videos
* end product images/videos/links/repo
* nounish artworks from contents & events
* cc0 contents & working files

There is so much great Nouns content scattered across different platforms that went by everyday in our ecosystem. We aim to solve this by providing a central platform where all Nouns-related content all in one place and make it easier for everyone to find it.

**In the past 4 months we have ;**

## **3. Project Goals For Upcoming 6 Months**

### **Why should we fund this extension?**

* We want to assist Nouns community, particularly builders and artists, to be able to contribute their project materials and outputs via the platform, which serves as the primary archive centre for the Nouns ecosystem that can be a good reference to others & later generations.
* It'd be one of the main onboarding tools that keeps track of everything that has occurred in Nouns DAO.
* We anticipate that the platform will inspire more builders & artists to produce remarkable & high-quality content.
* We believe that by developing a good proliferation strategies, complementary features & tools that cater the target audience could bring great values, increase targeted KPIs & enhance the product market fit of this project.

### **Strategy Details**

**For Website Enhancement & Features ;**

**1. Community archive submission**

![](https://i.imgur.com/EKvVcFO.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/zRGCmYR.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/kYzeI8v.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/AUrMjNR.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/1rQXaEQ.png)

* To build **a curated submission form** attached to the website which allows anyone to contribute to the platform.
* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) and could request to submit a new sub-category and additional contents to their existing proposals/details.
* The forms will allow users to select their preferred category, status, type of house, round, etc. *(based on specific usage)*
* User can check their submission history together with submission details *(eg; date, title & status)*

**2. Permanent storage media uploader**

![](https://i.imgur.com/gVzs6Ih.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/IoUQQkb.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/KFIzROZ.png)

* To improvise an [uploader](https://uploadr.app/) with some new features which we have built for the past few months.
* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) & it will be token gated focusing on Nouns ecosystem to use it for free ;
    * Nounders
    * Nouners
    * Nounish Builders
    * Sub DAOs
    * Nouns' NFT Open Edition Holders / Droposals *(This Is Nouns, The Wizard's Hat etc)*
* Anyone who has just got noun-pilled into the ecosystem and want to use it, they may choose from any of the available criteria above. This will gradually benefit the Nouns DAO ecosystem over time.
* User can check their upload history together with the details *(eg; date, title & arweave link)*

**3. Archivist/Contributor Leaderboard**

* We want to create archivist/contributor leaderboard with gamification where top contributors will be incentivised.
* We will use the fund under **OpEx** in ***Budget***.

**4. Feed**

Utilising a simplified and condensed data feed can be more efficient than navigating through an entire website for the required information, making data feed crucial for individual use cases. That is why we're adding feed as a new feature, to make it easier for you to access the data you need and achieve your goals more efficiently.

We will provide a few types of feed for the main & sub-category pages ;
  * RSS feed - /rss.xml
  * Atom  feed - /atom.xml
  * JSON feed - /feed.json

The data we have gathered can be utilised by everyone in the ecosystem for their own unique purposes. For instance, a mini companion app can directly use the JSON feed to list all proposals in NSFW Small Grants.

**For Proliferation Plan ;**

**1. Publications - Nouns Archive '23**

![](https://i.imgur.com/oDnnmMN.png)

* We will produce a yearly curated physical book that features the archive's contents.

**2. Nouns Zines**

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry1WxY_N3.png)

* We will produce a monthly curated zine that features great contents from Nouns ecosystem.

* Upon approval, we will start our first prop house round in June 2023.
* There will be **six rounds** in total, 5 rounds for Nouns Zine & 1 round for Nouns Archive '23.
* For each round, there will be ;
    * 3 winners with a prize pool of **0.45E** *(1st/0.2E, 2nd/0.15E & 3rd/0.1E)*
    * artwork of the **first-place winner** will be minted as open edition & to be featured as the zine cover of that month
    * artworks of the **second & third-place winner** will be featured in the zine of that month
    * **60%** of the proceeds goes to the DAO's treasury, **20%** goes to the artist & **20%** goes to Nouns Archive 
    * we will use **20%** of the proceeds to Nouns Archive to enhance the prize pool for future contests / add contest rounds / zine production etc

![](https://i.imgur.com/BibDiu5.png)

## TL;DR
Introducing Noun Computers! I propose to fund the development of credit card-sized computers that would be ideal for Ethereum staking.

NounsDAO's commitment to making individual staking fun and popular would be a net plus for the whole network and ecosystem's well-being.

In my opinion, focusing on the public good would increase the recognition and respect for NounsDAO, which is the best strategy for proliferation.

## Description
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk8iWv2H3.gif)

A lot of good single-board computers are available on the market, and the competition is stiff. However, the purpose of Noun Computers is not to dominate the market or make good profits. It is about a mission to do public good and unite like-minded developers, which will propel the nounish culture and memes. Of course, the key to success is a sustainable model. I believe Noun Computers will be successful because NounsDAO has an amazing culture, a better understanding of community, and connections in the blockchain circles. 

I propose the development of Noun Computers, which would run Linux operating system. These computers would be designed specifically for convenient Ethereum stacking, blockchain development, and practical programming learning. By doing so, we can establish a vibrant community of software and hardware developers who will eventually become good supporters and contributors to NounsDAO.

Just imagine, the next thousand ethereum stakers (potential nouners) are mingling somewhere at blockchain conferences at this very moment! A cool gadget like Noun Computer would make for a great conversation starter. It has the potential to attract the attention of numerous high-profile individuals. We will be able to onboard many people to buy our Noun Computers and run Ethereum nodes.

## Noun Computers
![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1k5pljSn.png)

Noun Computers will provide affordability, versatility, and the best price/performance/user experience within its category. I will design the Noun Computers from scratch. I majored in electrical engineering and computer science and have experience developing similar computer boards. Noun computers will be perfectly suited for running Ethereum nodes, software/hardware hacking, and teaching programming. 

Once the project is completed, I will deliver PCB designs, blueprints, bill of materials, and estimated costs for mass production. In the future, NounsDAO will have the ability to order large batches of computers at wholesale prices. Additionally, we can develop expansion modules, interesting interfaces, and manufacture nounish cases to further enhance the product line.

In this project, I will focus on developing state of the art prototypes and estimating manufacturing cost. The limited supply of 50 prototypes will be used to create visibility and promote NounsDAO at conferences.

- A Noun Computer equipped with a 1.5GHz CPU, 8GB RAM, and a 2TB M.2 SSD for running an Ethereum node will cost around $80 to $110.
- A light version of Noun Computer with less memory can cost as low as $50
- If there is significant demand and Noun Computers are produced in large quantities (3,000-5,000 units), the manufacturing cost can be further lowered, making Noun Computers a sustainable model for proliferation. The proceeds from sales could then be utilized to manufacture more computers and introduce additional accessories.

## Deliverables
- Design blueprints, schematics, and a plan for mass production of Noun Computers
- 50 units of Noun Computer prototypes with aluminum head-crt-bsod case
    - 10 units - distributed to Nouns' auction winners (starting with the first auction on the opening day of ETH Global NY or Istanbul)
    - 10 units - showcase and distribute at conferences
    - 30 units - organize ETH Global Hackathon competition centered around Noun Computers

## Timeline
**Phase I - Prototyping (4~6 months)**
- [Jun~Aug 2023] Design and Manufacture Noun-Computer prototypes
- [Sep or Nov 2023] Bring Noun Computers to ETH Global hackathon and organize hacking competition

## Outsourcing companies
I have many years of experience working with two great companies KS Technology and Hansaem digitec.
- KS Technology https://altium.kr/
- Hansaem digitec https://www.hsdgt.com/main/main.html

## Future opportunities
- **[Proliferation]** We can **sponsor ETH hackathons** and supply Noun Computers for hardware hackathons. Expansion modules such as camera, NFC, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, and others would open doors for new, fun, and practical blockchain applications. In the long term, we can grow a community of developers around Noun Computers.
- **[Onboarding]** We can manufacture Noun Computers in large quantities and offer them at affordable prices. By doing so, we could **onboard the Ethereum community** and encourage their contribution to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by **running Ethereum nodes**.
- **[Public Good]** We can **allocate 20%~30%** of the future supply of Noun Computers to NounsDAO Public Good Fund. Nouners will be able to request computers via an on-chain proposal and send them to **developing countries and minority groups**. Noun Computers can be used to teach practical programming at schools and universities. It is a good way to put resources into the hands of people.

## TLDR
Why don’t we have a proper Nounish display font? Let’s make one that everybody can use. Recognizable, fun, CC0. For Nouns projects, products and beyond. 
Requesting 18 eth. 

### See the draft letter drawings in use: [nounsfonts.wtf](https://nounsfonts.wtf)

## WHY
On websites, videos, gear, and other items, the display typeface a user sees is one of the most critical aspects of visual recognition. 
    
A display typeface performs numerous functions like an oft-needed guide for a weary traveler. It reassures users, gives them a good feeling, creates understanding, and establishes direction. Of all the typefaces used in Nouns materials–outside of Nountown–none feel particularly Nounish. This is because there aren’t any genuinely Nounish display fonts available for use. We aim to solve that–Nouners need more tools for their evergrowing toolbox to help spread the lore of Nouns.
    
The [Nountown](https://nouns.center/assets) typeface is inspiring. Picking up where Gremplin left off, I propose creating a unique, beautiful, functional Nounish display typeface with a CC0 license available for general use. We use CC0, so this font can be a starting point for a whole suite of open-source Nounish fonts, bolstering the ecosystem visually. **Nouns Display is a font L1 that many L2s can be built on. Eg., Nouns Display and lil nouns display.**

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1_CqbhBn.png)

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1Xaobnr2.png)
   
Thanks to the generous support of our [prop house proposal](https://prop.house/proposal/5071) we have a start. The initial sketches, and process can be seen on our microsite [nounsfonts.wtf ](https://nounsfonts.wtf)

This proposal allows us to finish a full-featured CCO typeface that everyone can use on nouns projects, products, and beyond.

    
## GETTING IT OUT THERE

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJCC9AsH3.jpg)

We will produce a limited run of distinctly tasteful gear featuring the typeface upon launch.

We will submit Nouns Display for inclusion in the Google Fonts catalogue for wide distribution and easy use in Figma. 
    
It will be used on [Zora’s new profiles pages](https://zora.co/profiles). 
    
We will structure a Zora-based NFT launch when the typeface is complete. **Nouns Display would be the first NFT of a usable production typeface, effectively disrupting the typeface industry with NFTs and opening up a new paradigm for fonts as financial assets.**


## WHO
I am Marco Braunschweiler, a designer with a background in art, and I make typefaces that I use everyday. I’ve worked with Tribute Labs, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Acura, Sonos, The New York Times, and NTS Radio.

My fonts are here: [m-a-r-c-o.com/typefaces](https://m-a-r-c-o.com/typefaces)
My design studio is here: [openwindow.studio](https://openwindow.studio)


## ROADMAP
Phase 1 is complete. This proposal is for phases 2, and 3. Requesting 18 ETH.

**Phase One – Complete**
*Initial Sketches of Uppercase Letterforms*
We want to make sure we’re getting it right and creating something everyone loves; in this phase, we’ve done the research and made sketches for the initial letters, uppercase A–Z. Results are viewable at [nounsfonts.wtf](https://nounsfonts.wtf).


**Phase Two – Up Next**
*Drawing all Latin Glyphs*
Now that research is done and a direction is established, we draw all the uppercase and lowercase Latin glyphs. At the end of this phase, we will have drawings of all the characters used. We will work with Nounish designers to test the typeface and collect feedback.

    
**Phase Three – Finish Line**
*Updates, Revision, Mastering*
The finish line. We work to refine the typeface and master it for use across platforms. At the end of this phase, we have the final files that anyone can use to make their projects, and the world, look a bit more Nounish.

    
**Spec Sheet**
Final typeface will be ready for wide-use, and will include the following:
* CC0 License
* Mastering
* Hinting
* Unicode data normalization
* Opentype feature checks
* Metrics normalization/optimisation for desktop, mobile, and web environments
* Generating final desktop and webfont files in: OTF, TTF, WOFF, WOFF2
* Submission to Google Fonts

Title of this exhibition We created a title logo that utilizes Japanese tradition and brush strokes.
It represents this event in a lighthearted manner, evoking the image of tradition and newness/future.

  # Over view
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Nouns Mirai Japan is an activity in which we, pNounsDAO, will hold simultaneous events at WebX, Web3 Conference Asia, and our own metaverse space at the Tokyo International Forum in July, to share with event participants a new future where Nouns has penetrated society.

# TL;DR
・A comprehensive event for Metaverse and IRL to dramatically increase the visibility of Nouns.

・A festival of people and art that depicts a future society in which Nouns have permeated Japan.

・IRL will exhibit a Japanese booth at Web X, a global Web3 conference.

・In Metaverse, we will recreate Japanese side streets and summer festivals, and will decorate the events with live music.


## Challenges in Web3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
People involved in Web3 have a common challenge.
That is that there are still so many people in the world who have never heard of or touched web3.

In the Web2 world, Facebook has over 3 billion people worldwide,
Youtube and WhatsApp have over 2 billion, WeChat and Tik Tok have over 1 billion users.

Meanwhile, the number of virtual currency and web3 users worldwide is 320 million worldwide, which is only about 4.2% of the world's population.

In Japan, the number of crypto asset holders is said to be 11%, and the number of NFT buyers in Japan is 20,000. It can be said that Web3 has not yet penetrated the general public. Naturally, even fewer people know about nouns.

However, due to the growth of the blockchain field and the fact that nouns and Noggles are IPs using CC0We imagine that nouns and Noggles will gradually penetrate the market and become a commonplace part of society in the future.
This is the timeline we are aiming for and realizing, we believe that participating in the Web3 Conference is very meaningful.


## Concept
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**“ Mirai ” means Future.**


〜The future of nouns and noggles in Japan.  
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　A place to showcase such a future, one step ahead〜

![ブースの絵](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Gdk1pdy1AoOpovc7uDXXrDq1AYUPjIAa)


## TL;DR

Using a booth at the WebX conference, a small space of 3m✖️3m✖️2.7m will be used to express the spirit of Japanese hospitality, ""Teahouse"". We will introduce the future of the fusion of nouns and Japan to visitors using the spirit of harmony (exhibition), art (live painting), and metaverse (technology).


## Key Points

Nouns characters and Noggles will blend naturally with Tatami mats and Japanese culture, showing the futuristic fun of mixed culture.

We will set up a unique and different Japanese-style room in the business conference space to provide visitors with the experience of taking off their shoes and sitting on tatami mats.

In the Tatami room, noggle type VR glasses will be provided. Each guest will be guided to Nouns street in Co-Mati, a Japanese-style space in the Metaverse Spatial space, using their own smartphone. Various real and virtual hospitality related to Nouns will be offered here.



## “Noren” and “Tea room” that invite you to Mirai
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


![茶室と暖簾の絵](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-lnd16j4m-dZbNEcswOCfmM7yhktCRgn)


〜The spirit of Japanese hospitality ""Teahouse"" and the sense of anticipation after passing through the ""noren"" curtain.This ""tearoom"" is used as a ""portal"" to connect to Nouns' Mirai = ""Future"".

Japanese hospitality is based on the spirit of ""tea ceremony,"" a form of hospitality that is appropriate to not be pretentious
The ""noren"" (traditional Japanese curtains) hanging in front of stores in Japan are not only used as signboards, but are also used to show the store's credibility and pride. Such a uniquely Japanese interior is expressed in a small space of 3m✖️3m.

Visitors pass through the noren (curtain) and are invited to enter a small but isolated Japanese space with tatami mats. In this small space, we commissioned a master craftsman and a noren workshop to create a small Japanese room that can be incorporated into modern life, creating an interior that makes the most of the small space.

At the booth, a live painting event will be held, where Makoto Tagawa, a painter, will create a key visual of NounsMiraiJAPAN from scratch on a pure white wall of 2.7m✖️3.0m. What kind of work (future) will it be? Might it be different from the ""PopPopTokyo"" work shown at the beginning of the exhibition? We are looking forward to seeing it until the day of the event.

## Let's have fun at Nouns Japan small street""Yoko-cho""

In Japan, there are many small shopping streets called Yokocho. It would be exciting to have a Nouns Yokocho. We will start with the creation of a metaverse space (Spatial.io).

During the WebX conference, we will open the metaverse Nouns yoko-cho and organize real-time simultaneous events such as beginner's classes, stores, live performances, dance performances, poetry readings, etc. in the Terakoya for those who don't know about Nouns.

We are planning to have painters, dancers, Youtubers, musicians, and many other genres to entertain visitors to Nouns Yokocho. Non-visitors are also welcome to participate in the event in metaverse from all over the world.



##  Enjoy events all day long!
In the Metaverse space, the background changes between daytime and nighttime hours.

_Thank you to Lil Nouns for your support and feedback over the last week. We garnered [record support from the DAO](https://lilnouns.proplot.wtf/idea/529), as well as valuable feedback from many members that helped improve our prop. We look forward to supporting the Lils and being part of the community!_
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## TL;DR:

* We are proposing to use our Matr Labs robotics to fabricate 1,001 Nouns on-demand from #0 to #1,000. Artmatr will develop custom software and hardware to pull off this feat, including an exclusive airdropped physical redemption token, MATRing portal with algorithmic and AI creative control, cutting edge tool development, and the extensive code development required to tie it all together. All Noun holders will have the right to customize and claim their respective physical copy(s).  
* All shipping and handling costs to deliver the physical work to community members will be covered by Artmatr. We will create or employ a shipping system that ensures anonymity of any address information needed.
* Complementary digital content, including timelapse videos and high-resolution photography, will be available to Nouns holders and the community, and the airdropped redemption tokens will update to display the MATRed Nouns upon completion.
* We will produce a massive Nouniversary event at Artmatr’s gallery, showcasing some of the first MATRed Nouns with live MATRing throughout the day.
* This project will add a significant amount of new value to existing Nouns mints, as well as upcoming auctions. The content created by each Noun’s MATRing process will be widely distributed and shared, elevating visibility of the innovative ways Nouns can be works of art IRL, and the Nouniversary will be an opportunity to showcase that! We will also allocate any secondary royalties of the Matr Labs x Nouns token to the Nouns treasury.

## Overview

Our [last prop](https://nouns.wtf/vote/224) allowed Artmatr the opportunity to develop and create seven unique paintings of Nouns over the course of one week in March. Each day’s minted Noun was interpreted by our team of artists and engineers and “MATRed” on the same day as a 48” x 48” oil painting with our custom robotic hardware and code. The winner of each auction was given the rights to the corresponding painting. We celebrated the week of Nouns art with a successful public exhibition and VIP opening in our Brooklyn gallery, attended by major artists, gallerists, and auctioneers from the New York art scene.

We’re excited to follow up on the success of Prop 224 with a massive endeavor to bring physical art to every Nouner in the world. With the help of the Nouns community’s creative input, we propose to MATR 1,001 Nouns and distribute them globally to their respective holders. [Each Noun-holding wallet will be airdropped a Matr Labs token that can be redeemed for a physical. ](https://vimeo.com/830696167)We will update the metadata of the token upon redemption with a hi-res image of the Matr’d Noun, which will provide a digital Certificate of Authenticity for each physical piece of art. Supporting this huge development and production effort, we will deploy curated content across a variety of social channels, raising visibility of Nouns DAO and the ways Nouns create value and delight for the both broader Web3 community as well as the community of artists and art collectors that we are fostering.

This project aims to return on investment to the Nouns DAO in as many ways as possible, through high-quality content, marketing, and sponsorship visibility. We will publicly celebrate this endeavor with a huge launch party and exhibition near the August 8th Nouniversary and we will continue to promote this effort through dedicated social channels throughout the rest of the year and into 2024. We also propose that one of our cutting-edge MATR Labs machine racks gets built with custom Nouns sponsorship visibility, so that Noggles and Nouns branding can be seen in the content generated by every piece of art created on the machine.

## Recap
[![image6.png](https://i.postimg.cc/B6wL4HwZ/image6.png)](https://postimg.cc/njBc1jJN)

Prop 224 passed on February 13, 2023, to a resounding yes vote of 151 to 17. We immediately began developing ways we could use our custom robots and software to create a unique oil painting for each Noun over the prescribed week. We developed a number of stylistic directions that required new tools and hours of code development. Ultimately, we created paintings with unique robotically-created textures in the oil paint that brought dimensionality and life to Nouns, and embedded the mint hash into the paintings as well.

[![image9.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/NF9yMFW6/image9.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/4HG42f4y)

We wrote thousands of lines of code to reinterpret the digital images as paintings, honed the tooling, mixed the paint, and arranged the cameras. As proposed, we completed a unique painting of that day’s Noun, on time, and live streamed the entire process, as well as a 3D scan of each finished work for our virtual gallery. The project pushed our technical limits to the edge and allowed us to try new creative techniques that have greatly improved our art-making processes as a whole.

[![image17.png](https://i.postimg.cc/q71gx2rc/image17.png)](https://postimg.cc/Nyrgg95L)

During production time our Twitter and Instagram feeds were full of Nouns as our content and marketing team came up with new and creative ways to showcase the community through the paintings. The project generated great buzz from the community, and generated auction prices above the previous 30-day average, including a 36.69 ETH sale on the genesis painting. The week was capped off with a successful [first-ever exhibition in the Artmatr space in Brooklyn](https://vimeo.com/829178232). The works have been seen and talked about by major collectors, artists, galleries and auction houses, including Christie’s, Pace, Pioneer Works, and many other VIP’s in the crypto and traditional art communities.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Since the passing and success of our last Prop, Artmatr has grown significantly. We’ve scaled up, adding seasoned Project, Operations, and Product Managers, as well as building a dedicated 3 person marketing team. Our engineering team has also expanded, driving our hardware and software development at breakneck speeds. We held an exhibition opening with Zancan at our Brooklyn gallery space that 500 people attended, and other art from the Artmatr lab has been shown at Pace Gallery and Unit London, among other established galleries worldwide. Our Twitter following has more than doubled, and we engage with a diverse and growing audience across our popular Tik Tok, Instagram, Twitch, and Discord channels. Our organic reach has been very strong, maintaining an impressive 10.5% average engagement rate, with over 400k impressions in the period following the original Prop.

We learned specific lessons from the execution of our first proposal. The most important thing is that we want to prioritize total community engagement, both the whole Nouns community and our growing Web3-curious traditional art world community. By scaling down the final pieces and allowing anyone to MATR a Noun using a redemption token, we think this project will have a much broader impact. We also want to stress the effort that we plan to put into this project to raise visibility of the Nouns DAO through our social channels. We see each MATRed piece as an opportunity to spread the word about the creativity of the community and promote the brand, and our automated cameras will capture and produce a timelapse video of the MATRing process of each created work. We will also explore collaborative Nouns MATRing with our community of blue-chip artists.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## New Prop
[![Untitled.png](https://i.postimg.cc/2SDp85Jn/Untitled.png)](https://postimg.cc/nC0S3nnL)
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Our new Matr Labs platform consisting of newly developed art-making software and scaled down versions of our large machines will incorporate technology distilled from our experiences with the likes of Tyler Hobbs, Zancan and other brilliant artists we work with. The technology is entering a production-ready state from an initial prototype, and we want the Nouns community to work with us as we continue to develop and scale. We are committed to pushing the envelope of technological creativity, and with the assistance of Nouns DAO, we will help define the bridge between digital and physical artwork for a future generation of artists. 

[![image16.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Z0zq5cPm/image16.png)](https://postimg.cc/D45hC1Yp)

We would like to propose that every Noun holder from #0 to #1000 will have the opportunity to use our new platform and generate a unique 18” x 18” unique physical rendition of a Noun (their own, another from the collection, or a new noun from the Playground). Each MATRed Noun will be shipped to the holder at no additional cost, worldwide. 

[![image12.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MHCnjxSh/image12.png)](https://postimg.cc/ctcxVp6m)

_User flow: User starts by connecting their wallet & choosing their Noun on the server > Personalizes the Noun > server generated a preview with the translation layer > users has three choices: Modify the artwork, Save the preview for consideration or send to MATR > during the MATRing process, the work is captured in high res and when the MATR process is finished, the work is minted and shipped._
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The key to MATRing a physical Noun will be the 1,0001 redemption tokens, which will be airdropped to all wallets holding Nouns and will continue to be distributed as new Nouns are minted and won - up to #1,000. In the spirit of Noun’s CC0 license, a redemption token holder will be able to use any Noun in the collection as inspiration for their physical. The tokens can also be traded in the event that a holder does not want a physical, and royalties will be sent to the treasury.

[![](https://i.postimg.cc/PxwJnx90/Group-10.png)](https://vimeo.com/830696167)

The physical pieces created by the Nouns community and anyone outside who acquires a redemption token will generate increased visibility and value to the DAO, as existing holders and new auction winners alike will be given the opportunity to create a physical representation of their Noun with their own creative input. This creates both physical permanence for the Nouns in the world, as well as the possibility for virality for every related social media post that is shared. Additionally, we will also brand our newly-produced robot with Nouns branding, elevating Nouns visibility alongside the growth of this initiative. This machine will get heavy use, with time lapses and photos being core to the creation process, so the Nouns will be visually associated with the works created by incredible artists using the same tech.

[![image4.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qvdtJkQK/image4.png)](https://postimg.cc/VdDs4Pxs)
*_Concept of Nouns Sponsored Matr Labs Rack_*

Having the Nouns community with us will give us the freedom to come up with exciting new ways to implement our technology that we may not otherwise have been able to do when operating within the constraints of an individual artist. We want to continue pushing the boundaries of our technology in order to make art that excites both the Nouns community and our community at-large.
[![image13.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/k4DG1DM0/image13.gif)](https://postimg.cc/mzfThLHj)
We are eager to develop and employ our new tech at the epic scale that it was built for. We went big with this project, and want the community to feel that their money is well spent. It is easy to quantify the project on a per-print cost basis, but do keep in mind that we are also committing to a constant stream of content, marketing, and PR on behalf of the Nouns DAO, an epic NYC event as part of the Nouniversary celebrations, and development of a new Matr Labs robot that will be Nouns sponsored and branded. We feel that these intangibles will bring a lot of value and visibility to the community, while allowing us the opportunity to build the tech to its full potential in a shortened period of  time.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Timeline & Milestones

* Immediately following the acceptance of the proposal, Artmatr will begin development of a custom Nouns DAO creative interface and the construction of a Nouns-sponsored Matr Labs rack. We will open up private social channels on Discord and provide regular updates on the progress made on both the hardware and software development. We will stay active in those channels for enthusiasts of the technology to engage with our team of artists and engineers and also promote the project development publicly via our Twitter & Instagram. 
* Artmatr will use the community Nouns as our test materials during the summer development process, and will publish the results as the works are formed.
* Near the public launch of the Matr portal, we will airdrop Matr Labs x Nouns redemption tokens to all wallets holding Nouns. We will continue to distribute those tokens to new holders up to #1,000.
* We will officially launch the token-gated Nouns website for the community to start generating works using the Nouns on August 1. Shortly thereafter, we will host a live gallery event at Artmatr in NYC near the August 8th Nouniversary. We will exhibit the community Nouns created by Artmatr at the event, and allow Nouns holders the ability to create their work live that day.
* The community-exclusive MATRing will remain active until January 31, allowing the community to create unique works of art from the Nouns that they hold in their wallets, utilizing a specialized UI which includes a number of AI and algorithmic features. Noun holders will be able to customize their Noun to create a unique work of art using pens, brushes, and our proprietary painting tools, MATRed on acid-free, archival grade 100 lb Bristol cardstock. The works will be shipped to each community member as they are made free of charge.
* Timelapse video and hi-rez photos of each work will be collected and collated by our automated systems, and will be used to generate additional visibility of the project via dedicated Twitter and Discord channels. The content will also be available on our website, and used to update the metadata of the redemption tokens, transforming the airdrop into a new collection of MATRed Nouns.
* We commit to doing everything we can to ensure the anonymity of the Nouns DAO community. We are closely aligned with a number of other cryptoart companies who have been working to address this issue (Artfora, for example) and we are working with them on solutions. We are exploring address escrow services, secure databases that automatically delete information after use, and other methods. We want to work with the community in a variety of ways to ensure as many people have access to physical prints as possible and would post instructions on how to address a package to a UPS store or PO Box for additional anonymization.

## About

Artmatr’s team of experts from the art, robotics, Web3, and marketing worlds are focused on broadly expanding every artists’ creative toolkit. We want to make our highly sophisticated hardware and software technologies available to everyone, from the biggest names in art to an emerging creative at home. We have so far demonstrated our ability to execute bespoke projects at a small scale, and now we are ready to start opening the doors to the world at-large. 

Led by CEO Rafael Feitelberg and CCO Ben Tritt, Artmatr’s creative studio in Brooklyn and R&D lab in Israel are developing revolutionary art-making tools and techniques. Our Brooklyn studio has a steady stream of artists coming in with brand new creative ideas unlocked thanks to our expanding technology. This tech platform is a significant part of our future development pipeline with the artists, platforms and galleries that we are working with. We also are developing ways for the public to access this tech and “Matr” their own custom creations. We have plans to scale this product to democratize the creation of physical artwork. In the medium term, it will allow us to have a sustainable solution for artists to work on ideas that may be higher volume and more accessible to a larger collector base. Having Nouns DAO as our development sponsor will accelerate our timeline and product viability for artists to start using it. We think this will be one of our marquee tools, and Nouns will cement themselves in the art community with the legacy and visibility of being the first to use it.

Since our launch mid-2022, we have had successful projects with Tyler Hobbs, Zancan, Matthew Stone and Matthew Day Jackson, and our 2023 pipeline is full of exciting projects with blue-chip and emerging artists alike.

302,Fund a code4rena audit for DAO V3,"# Fund a code4rena audit for DAO V3

## TLDR

Send 200K USDC to the [Tech Grants Safe](https://etherscan.io/address/0x79095391743e0f017A16c388De6a6a3f175a5cD5) to fund the second audit of the upcoming DAO V3 upgrade proposal.

## Context on V3

A quick summary of what's coming:
1. **Nouns Fork**: a new minority protection mechanism allowing Nouners to exit into a fork of Nouns DAO.
2. **Proposal editing**: allowing proposers to update their proposal's transactions and text description, during the new Updatable period, which starts as soon as the proposal goes onchain, and ends when voting delay starts.
3. **Propose by signature**: allowing Nouners and delegates to pool their voting power towards submitting a proposal, by submitting their signature, instead of the current approach where sponsors must delegate their votes to help a proposer achieve threshold.
4. **Objection-only Period**: a conditional voting period that gets activated upon a last-minute proposal swing from defeated to successful, affording against voters more reaction time.
5. **Votes Snapshot After Voting Delay**: moving votes snapshot up, to provide Nouners with reaction time per proposal, to get their votes ready (e.g. some might want to move their delegations around).

For a longer description of Nouns Fork, please refer to [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/iN0FKOn_oYVBzlJkwPwK2mhzaeL8K2-W80u82F7fHj8). A longer post about the other V3 features will be posted between now and the upgrade proposal.

## Context on how it's audited

Given the complexity of the DAO V3 upgrade, a second audit is necessary to uncover potential vulnerabilities potentially missed in the first round.

* On June 1st we started the first audit with [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com/), using funds Tech Grants already had. This audit is underway and should end around June 20th.
* We're allocating roughly two weeks between the first and second audit for fixes that may arise, and a chance for the Spearbit auditors to review those fixes.
* On the week of July 3rd we hope to start the code4rena audit, which should take 10 days, with an option to pay for a 'mitigations review', which we're likely to want if there are any non-negligible issues that come up in this audit.

## Budget

code4rena's quote consists of:
1. $148K for the audit, out of which $100K are the pool prize going to auditors.
2. $50K for the optional mitigations review.

Comes out to $198K; we're rounding up our request to $200K to have another slight buffer.

Any unused funds will be sent back to the DAO.",PENDING,17423093,17459093,1,73,,1000000,1000,1500,730,0,0,0,"['0', '45163461840673738846']","['0xd97bcd9f47cee35c0a9ec1dc40c1269afc9e8e1d', '0x4f2acdc74f6941390d9b1804fabc3e780388cfe5']","['sendOrRegisterDebt(address,uint256)', '']",17387093,1685636243,0x5d6c05ff221477c1eb2cbadfb915ba50bc138ed1316db99b89fb2dffe50a88a2,"['0x00000000000000000000000079095391743e0f017a16c388de6a6a3f175a5cd50000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002e90edd000', '0x']",0xe26d78c6bff297bbc2da3f80fea9a42028a4260f

### OPPORTUNITY
We seek funding to revitalize Silverado Park Skatepark in Long Beach, California, with new elements and relocate the ones that are still skateable. A collaborative design between Spohn Ranch Skateparks and Keen Ramps for a new, all-concrete park is ready to be built and now just needs the funding to complete the build. The area surrounding the skatepark is predominantly low-income, with many at-risk youths with few recreational opportunities. Together with the local Action Sports Kids (ASK) Foundation, we will unlock the potential of Silverado Skatepark to create a space that will benefit Long Beach area skaters, youth and community members for generations to come.


### [THE SKATEPARK PROJECT](https://skatepark.org/)
The Skatepark Project (TSP) builds more than skateparks. We build confidence. We build perseverance. We build community. 

Founded by Tony Hawk in 2002, TSP is a nonprofit organization working to increase access to outdoor recreation and free play in underserved communities through the creation of safe and inclusive skateparks. To date, TSP has helped build nearly 700 skateparks in underserved communities across the United States serving nearly 9 million skaters each year.


### ACTION SPORTS KIDS (ASK) FOUNDATION
Founded by former Long Beach City Councilman Mike Donelon and a group of skaters in 1996, Action Sports Kids (ASK) Foundation is a nonprofit in Long Beach, California, dedicated to providing youth an alternative to the streets and gangs through sports, education and community involvement. Their efforts to keep their team members in school, out of gangs, off the streets and involved in their community through skateboarding has been recognized by the Long Beach Unified School District and the City of Long Beach.

ASK is responsible for all 10 Long Beach skateparks. Their skate team has more than 175 members, ages 3-25, comprised of diverse genders and ethnicities, and applications continue to come in every day. 

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
The effort to reimagine the Silverado Skatepark began in April 2021 with the encouragement of local skaters. The 5,000-square-foot skatepark was built on an old basketball court located on the west side of Long Beach, California. Separated by the Los Angeles River from the rest of the city, it is the only skatepark in underserved West Long Beach. The elements in the park were relocated from the Michael K. Green and Bixby (Cherry) Skateparks after their respective refurbishment. Dew Tour also donated some in 2018. The park has undergone many repairs over the years. With the exception of a few elements, most are unrepairable and render the park useless due to excessive use.

The skatepark project has been approved by the office of City of Long Beach Councilmember Roberto Uranga and the City of Long Beach Department of Parks, Recreation and Marine. On September 16, 2021, the City issued a two-year right of access to build the skatepark.

*“Our mission at ASK is to empower youth through sports, education, and community. This skatepark is in an underserved area and was heavily used. Rebuilding it will bring back a beloved activity and after-school alternative for at-risk youth.”* - Mike Donelon, founder and executive director of ASK



### FUNDING OPPORTUNITY
This proposal requests a total of ~87 ETH upfront from the DAO for the entire project. See attached cost breakdown.

![Skate Park Reno](https://i.imgur.com/jgimcz9.png)
***Sample Mockup, exact art not shown.** Detailed Nouns Artwork (Noun Characters, Noggles, ect) will be illustrated on various fixtures throughout the park.*

### TIMELINE
The project is expected to take a maximum of four weeks to complete. The exact start date depends on the builders’ schedule, but ASK anticipates beginning the construction during summer 2023. Please note the schedule can only be finalized once funding is secured.


**Nouns Artwork** — The Nouns artwork and noggles rail have been viewed and approved by the Long Beach Parks and Recreation Commission. Keen Ramps has recommended working with Van Eggers (@van_eggers), a talented illustrator working out of Long Beach. He has done work for clients such as Foundation Skateboards, Girl Skateboards and Deathwish Skateboards. Oni Apenoun will be coordinating with ASK and Van Eggers to provide assets and assist in creative direction.

**Noggles Rail** — Keen Ramps will manage building, powder coating and installing the signature Noggles Rail.

Upon approval of funding, Spohn Ranch will carry out the project according to the original design, excluding the Nouns rail and artwork. Subsequently, they will handle the installation of the noogles rail and the painting of the artwork.

### TSP PARTNERSHIP PROMOTION
TSP will promote the partnership and funding support through dedicated social media posts on TSP's platforms. Additionally, TSP will include relevant tags and mentions in social media posts related to the skatepark project, extending its reach and generating a significant impact.

### NOUNS X ASK LONG BEACH PARTNERSHIP HISTORY
**October 2022** — Nouns DAO partnered with ASK Long Beach and TSP to give away skateboards to local youth at their team meeting/jams at Houghton Skatepark. The boards were funded and designed by Nouns DAO and built by TSP staff and volunteers.

![Skatepark Kids Pic](https://i.imgur.com/0MftGcz.png)

**January  2023** —  ASK Long Beach skateboarders showed their stuff aboard the “Meet the Nouns” float in the 134th annual Rose Parade in Pasadena, California. Mike Donelon and several team skaters participated, with some kids on the float and others skateboarding alongside it as it traveled down the parade route.
