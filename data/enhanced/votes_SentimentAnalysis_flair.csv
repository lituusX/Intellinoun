Completely.

When I was young I had no sense of myself. All I was, was a product of all the fear and humiliation I suffered. Fear of my parents. The humiliation of teachers calling me ‚Äúgarbage can‚Äù and telling me I‚Äôd be mowing lawns for a living. And the very real terror of my fellow students. I was threatened and beaten up for the color of my skin and my size. I was skinny and clumsy, and when others would tease me I didn‚Äôt run home crying, wondering why.

I knew all too well. I was there to be antagonized. In sports I was laughed at. A spaz. I was pretty good at boxing but only because the rage that filled my every waking moment made me wild and unpredictable. I fought with some strange fury. The other boys thought I was crazy.

I hated myself all the time.

As stupid at it seems now, I wanted to talk like them, dress like them, carry myself with the ease of knowing that I wasn‚Äôt going to get pounded in the hallway between classes. Years passed and I learned to keep it all inside. I only talked to a few boys in my grade. Other losers. Some of them are to this day the greatest people I have ever known. Hang out with a guy who has had his head flushed down a toilet a few times, treat him with respect, and you‚Äôll find a faithful friend forever. But even with friends, school sucked. Teachers gave me hard time.

I didn‚Äôt think much of them either.

Then came Mr. Pepperman, my advisor. He was a powerfully built Vietnam veteran, and he was scary. No one ever talked out of turn in his class. Once one kid did and Mr. P. lifted him off the ground and pinned him to the black board. Mr. P. could see that I was in bad shape, and one Friday in October he asked me if I had ever worked out with weights. I told him no.

He told me that I was going to take some
of the money that I had saved and buy a hundred pound set of weights at Sears. As I left his office, I started to think of things I would say to him on Monday when he asked about the weights that I was not going to buy. Still, it made me feel special. My father never really got that close to caring. On Saturday I bought the weights, but I couldn‚Äôt even drag them to my mom‚Äôs car. An attendant laughed at me as he put them on a dolly.

Monday came and I was called into Mr. P.‚Äôs office after school. He said that he was going to show me how to work out. He was going to put me on a program and start hitting me in the solar plexus in the hallway when I wasn‚Äôt looking. When I could take the punch we would know that we were getting somewhere. At no time
was I to look at myself in the mirror or tell anyone at school what I was doing. In the gym he showed me ten basic exercises. I paid more attention than I ever did in any of my classes. I didn‚Äôt want to blow it. I went home that night and started right in.

Weeks passed, and every once in a while Mr. P. would give me a shot and drop me in the hallway, sending my books flying. The other students didn‚Äôt know what to think. More weeks passed, and I was steadily adding new weights to the bar. I could sense the power inside my body growing. I could feel it.

Right before Christmas break I was walking to class, and from out of nowhere Mr. Pepperman appeared and gave me a shot in the chest. I laughed and kept going. He said I could look at myself now. I got home and ran to the bathroom and pulled off my shirt. I saw a body, not just the shell that housed my stomach and my heart. My biceps bulged. My chest had definition. I felt strong. It was the first time I can remember having a sense of myself. I had done something and no one could ever take it away.

You couldn‚Äôt say s‚Äìt to me.

It took me years to fully appreciate the value of the lessons I have learned from the Iron. I used to think that it was my adversary, that I was trying to lift that which does not want to be lifted. I was wrong. When the Iron doesn‚Äôt want to come off the mat, it‚Äôs the kindest thing it can do for you. If it flew up and went through the ceiling, it wouldn‚Äôt teach you anything. That‚Äôs the way the Iron talks to you. It tells you that the material you work with is that which you will come to resemble.

That which you work against will always work against you.

It wasn‚Äôt until my late twenties that I learned that by working out I had given myself a great gift. I learned that nothing good comes without work and a certain amount of pain. When I finish a set that leaves me shaking, I know more about myself. When something gets bad, I know it can‚Äôt be as bad as that workout.

I used to fight the pain, but recently this became clear to me: pain is not my enemy; it is my call to greatness. But when dealing with the Iron, one must be careful to interpret the pain correctly. Most injuries involving the Iron come from ego. I once spent a few weeks lifting weight that my body wasn‚Äôt ready for and spent a few months not picking up anything heavier than a fork. Try to lift what you‚Äôre not prepared to and the Iron will teach you a little lesson in restraint and self-control.

I have never met a truly strong person who didn‚Äôt have self-respect. I think a lot of inwardly and outwardly directed contempt passes itself off as self-respect: the idea of raising yourself by stepping on someone‚Äôs shoulders instead of doing it yourself. When I see guys working out for cosmetic reasons, I see vanity exposing them in the worst way, as cartoon characters, billboards for imbalance and insecurity. Strength reveals itself through character. It is the difference between bouncers who get off strong-arming people and Mr. Pepperman.

Muscle mass does not always equal strength. Strength is kindness and sensitivity. Strength is understanding that your power is both physical and emotional. That it comes from the body and the mind. And the heart.

Yukio Mishima said that he could not entertain the idea of romance if he was not strong. Romance is such a strong and overwhelming passion, a weakened body cannot sustain it for long. I have some of my most romantic thoughts when I am with the Iron. Once I was in love with a woman. I thought about her the most when the pain from a workout was racing through my body.

Everything in me wanted her. So much so that sex was only a fraction of my total desire. It was the single most intense love I have ever felt, but she lived far away and I didn‚Äôt see her very often. Working out was a healthy way of dealing with the loneliness. To this day, when I work out I usually listen to ballads.

I prefer to work out alone.

It enables me to concentrate on the lessons that the Iron has for me. Learning about what you‚Äôre made of is always time well spent, and I have found no better teacher. The Iron had taught me
how to live. Life is capable of driving you out of your mind. The way it all comes down these days, it‚Äôs some kind of miracle if you‚Äôre not insane. People have become separated from their bodies. They are no longer whole.

I see them move from their offices to their cars and on to their suburban homes. They stress out constantly, they lose sleep, they eat badly. And they behave badly. Their egos run wild; they become motivated by that which will eventually give them a massive stroke. They need the Iron Mind.

Through the years, I have combined meditation, action, and the Iron into a single strength. I believe that when the body is strong, the mind thinks strong thoughts. Time spent away from the Iron makes my mind degenerate. I wallow in a thick depression. My body shuts down my mind.

The Iron is the best antidepressant I have ever found. There is no better way to fight weakness than with strength. Once the mind and body have been awakened to their true potential, it‚Äôs impossible to turn back.

The Iron never lies to you. You can walk outside and listen to all kinds of talk, get told that you‚Äôre a god or a total bastard. The Iron will always kick you the real deal. The Iron is the great reference point, the all-knowing perspective giver. Always there like a beacon in the pitch black. I have found the Iron to be my greatest friend. It never freaks out on me, never runs. Friends may come and go. But two hundred pounds is always two hundred pounds.",59,Against,"believe definition definition reinvention like parent like friend

We would like to see, even from established brands, at least some basic mockups to determine whether the designs will be desirable, and/or Nounish.

I'm voting AGAINST since I'm opposed to sending a signal to present and future nouns extensions that we value receiving NFT supply allocation in a special way.

Receiving someone else's NFTs is kind of a headache. We're suddenly put into the position of having to make asset owner decisions (should we hold or sell) and in some cases such as this one we might have added governance responsibilities as well (e.g. have 10% responsibility of lil nouns' future). So unless we have some easy DAO level consensus on regularly selling the newly received NFTs, we're likely looking at the duties of holding onto an illiquid asset while incurring more DAO governance overhead. One might say that if we start receiving a lot of NFTs this way then some might really pop and have liquid markets and we might be able to experience some real ETH treasury gains through it. But if we really believed in that then we could have always bought new noun extension NFTs as pure investors with our ETH. I believe we have yet to do that because we don't think ourselves as NFT investors (even if the scope is limited to nouns extensions) and don't think that is where we create the most value from our attention. 

An arrangement that we'd much rather prefer than being gifted NFT supply is a nouns extension buying Nouns with their treasury. In this arrangement, we get ETH and likely some governance participation as well, both things that we really like and no added responsibilities that we don't like. 

I'm not saying that we should be stingy or completely self centered in a short term way. I think Lil Nouns is a brilliant experiment and love that we're for example spinning up a lil nouns prop house and sending ETH their way to help bootstrap builders there, etc. I just think that rewarding NFT supply gifting over other acts such as buying nouns or participating in our governance (which both sharkdao and goop have done) sends the wrong message that is against our incentives. We want extensions to buy Nouns, submit proposals, and participate in our governance! Giving us assets for free can be nice but comparatively is meh.

Most of the discussion on the Nouncil weekly call centered around feelings that the proposed garments did not look Nounish, or that the ""Nounish streetwear"" category was currently crowded with props such as Madhappy and Nouns Brand already in production. 

""Overall, I'm struggling with the 'nounishness' of this project. I'm a no for now,"" was one comment from our Nouncil Discussion Thread. ""It seems like a duplicative effort,"" was another. ""The generous 15:85 rev split isn‚Äôt enough to make up for the lack of Nounish brand experience.""  

Proponents of the project liked the novel NFT ownership verification, and the Nounish apparel mockups that were released maybe just a little too late to sway the vote (after the team spoke on The Noun Square last night and dropped into Nouncil to show Nounish mockups and clarify some things, a flood of YES votes did come in, but ultimately not enough to win the vote.) 

Example comments on the Discussion thread after the TNS appearance and new mockups: ""Having been sceptical, I've been really impressed by Dopamine on NoC. I think it's taken a while to articulate the scope of the vision, and why it's nounish: Community, web3 native, proof of work, tech innovation (and it will be fully noggle branded). I'm a yes."" And: ""I am as well. I feel like the concerns have been addressed and this could be a good experiment with digital/physical merch in a new way.""

Roark: Your Honor, I shall call no witnesses. This will be my testimony and my summation.

Judge: Take the oath.

Court Clerk: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

Roark: I do.

Thousands of years ago, the first man discovered how to make fire. He was probably burned at the stake he had taught his brothers to light, but he left them a gift they had not conceived, and he lifted darkness off the earth.

Throughout the centuries, there were men who took first steps down new roads, armed with nothing but their own vision. The great creators -- the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors -- stood alone against the men of their time. Every new thought was opposed; every new invention was denounced. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. They fought, they suffered, and they paid. But they won.

No creator was prompted by a desire to please his brothers. His brothers hated the gift he offered.

His truth was his only motive.

His work was his only goal.

His work -- not those who used it.

His creation -- not the benefits others derived from it -- the creation which gave form to his truth.

He held his truth above all things and against all men. He went ahead whether others agreed with him or not, with his integrity as his only banner. He served nothing and no one. He lived for himself. And only by living for himself was he able to achieve the things which are the glory of mankind. Such is the nature of achievement. Man cannot survive except through his mind. He comes on earth unarmed. His brain is his only weapon. But the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a collective brain. The man who thinks must think and act on his own. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsion. It cannot be subordinated to the needs, opinions, or wishes of others. It is not an object of sacrifice.

The creator stands on his own judgment; the parasite follows the opinions of others.

The creator thinks; the parasite copies.

The creator produces; the parasite loots.

The creator's concern is the conquest of nature; the parasite's concern is the conquest of men.

The creator requires independence. He neither serves nor rules. He deals with men by free exchange and voluntary choice.

The parasite seeks power. He wants to bind all men together in common action and common slavery. He claims that man is only a tool for the use of others -- that he must think as they think, act as they act, and live in selfless, joyless servitude to any need but his own.

Look at history: Everything we have, every great achievement has come from the independent work of some independent mind. Every horror and destruction came from attempts to force men into a herd of brainless, soulless robots -- without personal rights, without person ambition, without will, hope, or dignity.

It is an ancient conflict. It has another name: ""The individual against the collective.""

Our country, the noblest country in the history of men, was based on the principle of individualism, the principle of man's ""inalienable rights."" It was a country where a man was free to seek his own happiness, to gain and produce, not to give up and renounce; to prosper, not to starve; to achieve, not to plunder; to hold as his highest possession a sense of his personal value, and as his highest virtue his self-respect.

Look at the results. That is what the collectivists are now asking you to destroy, as much of the earth has been destroyed.

I am an architect. I know what is to come by the principle on which it is built. We are approaching a world in which I cannot permit myself to live. My ideas are my property. They were taken from me by force, by breach of contract. No appeal was left to me.

It was believed that my work belonged to others, to do with as they pleased. They had a claim upon me without my consent -- that it was my duty to serve them without choice or reward.

Now you know why a dynamited Courtland. I designed Courtland. I made it possible. I destroyed it. I agreed to design it for the purpose of it seeing built as I wished. That was the price I set for my work. I was not paid. My building was disfigured at the whim of others who took all the benefits of my work and gave me nothing in return.

I came here to say that I do not recognize anyone's right to one minute of my life, nor to any part of my energy, nor to any achievement of mine -- no matter who makes the claim!

It had to be said: The world is perishing from an orgy of self-sacrificing. I came here to be heard in the name of every man of independence still left in the world. I wanted to state my terms. I do not care to work or live on any others.

My terms are: A man's RIGHT to exist for his own sake.",130,For,"judge defense proceed

Meanwhile, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Place granulated sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.

However, im voting against based on a perceived lack of transparency and decentralization.

When it comes to DAO operations, there is an obvious tension between speed/efficiency and decentralization. The tradeoffs on either side of this spectrum are very real and often hard to grapple with. Im mindful of that.

But for a pod like this, there's a minimum level of decentralization that should be maintained, and its not clear to me if that is currently being met.

Whether intentional or due to gravitational forces of 'path of least resistance, my perception is that NSFW currently errs too much on the side of efficiency. 

Ive given this considerable thought and am aware of the tradeoffs, but ultimately think its better for the daos longterm health and culture to push back and 'check itself' in favor of preserving a high integrity re decentralization.

15785341,0x5ca6a2e5f53a48616d4ead87ff6034fc032d4722,True,1,1,"John David McAfee (/Ààm√¶k…ôfiÀê/ MAK-…ô-fee;[1][2] 18 September 1945 ‚Äì 23 June 2021)[3][4] was a British-American computer programmer, businessman, and two-time presidential candidate who unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party nomination for president of the United States in 2016 and in 2020. In 1987, he wrote the first commercial anti-virus software, founding McAfee Associates to sell his creation. He resigned in 1994 and sold his remaining stake in the company.[5] McAfee became the company's most vocal critic in later years, urging consumers to uninstall the company's anti-virus software, which he characterized as bloatware. He disavowed the company's continued use of his name in branding, a practice that has persisted in spite of a short-lived corporate rebrand attempt under Intel ownership.

McAfee's fortunes plummeted in the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. After leaving McAfee Associates, he founded the companies Tribal Voice (makers of the PowWow chat program), QuorumEx, and Future Tense Central, among others, and was involved in leadership positions in the companies Everykey, MGT Capital Investments, and Luxcore, among others. His personal and business interests included smartphone apps, cryptocurrency, yoga, light-sport aircraft[6] and recreational drug use. He resided for a number of years in Belize, but returned to the United States in 2013 while wanted in Belize for questioning on suspicion of murder.[7]

In October 2020, McAfee was arrested in Spain over U.S. tax evasion charges.[8] U.S. federal prosecutors brought criminal and civil charges alleging that McAfee had failed to file income taxes over a four-year period.[9][10] On 23 June 2021, he was found dead due to an apparent suicide by hanging in his prison cell near Barcelona shortly after the Spanish National Court authorized his extradition to the U.S.[11][12][13] His death generated speculation and conspiracy theories about the possibility that he was murdered.[14] McAfee's wife, Janice McAfee, said she did not believe McAfee committed suicide, and claimed the suicide note was a forgery.[15][16]

McAfee was born in Cinderford, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, England,[17] on 18 September 1945,[18] on a U.S. Army base (of the 596th Ordnance Ammunition Company), to an American father, Don McAfee, who was stationed there, and a British mother, Joan (Williams).[19][20] His father was from Roanoke, Virginia, and McAfee was himself primarily raised in Salem, Virginia, United States. He said he felt as much British as American.[21] When he was 15, his father, whom a BBC columnist described as ""an abusive alcoholic"", killed himself with a gun.[21] He had spent his childhood living in fear that a beating from his father could happen at any time, and struggled to make sense of why this was happening to him.[18]

McAfee received a bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1967 from Roanoke College in Virginia, which subsequently awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 2008.[22] After receiving his bachelor's degree, McAfee began working towards a doctorate in mathematics at Northeast Louisiana State College but was expelled, in about 1968, because of a relationship with an undergraduate student, who became his first wife.[23]

McAfee was employed as a programmer by NASA's Institute for Space Studies in New York City from 1968 to 1970 working on the Apollo program. From there, he went to Univac as a software designer, and later to Xerox as an operating system architect. In 1978, he joined Computer Sciences Corporation as a software consultant. He worked for consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton from 1980 to 1982.[24] In 1986, while employed by Lockheed, he read about the Brain computer virus made for the PC, and he found it terrifying.[23] Sensing a business opportunity, he went about creating an antivirus software that could detect the computer virus and remove it automatically.[20] In 1987 McAfee created McAfee Associates Inc. to sell this software, which he named VirusScan.[22] This was the first anti-virus software brought to market, and one of the first software products to be distributed over the Internet.[20][22]

Initially McAfee did not seek a large userbase of paying users, but rather wanted to raise awareness of the need to be protected from computer viruses. However, by making people fear such malware, he managed to generate millions of sales, and by 1990 he was making five million dollars a year.[18] The company was incorporated in Delaware in 1992, and had its initial public offering the same year. In August 1993, McAfee stepped down as chief executive and remained with the company as the chief technical officer. He was succeeded by Bill Larson.[25] In 1994 he sold his remaining stake in the company.[26] He had no further involvement in its operations.[5]

After various mergers and ownership changes, Intel acquired McAfee in August 2010.[27] In January 2014, Intel announced that McAfee-related products would be marketed as Intel Security. McAfee expressed his pleasure at the name change, saying, ""I am now everlastingly grateful to Intel for freeing me from this terrible association with the worst software on the planet.""[28] The business was soon de-merged from Intel, once more under the McAfee name.

Other business ventures that were founded by McAfee include Tribal Voice, which developed one of the first instant messaging programs,[29] PowWow. In 2000, he invested in and joined the board of directors of Zone Labs, makers of firewall software, prior to its acquisition by Check Point Software in 2003.[30]

In the 2000s McAfee invested in and advertised ultra-light flights, which he marketed as aerotrekking.[6]

In August 2009 The New York Times reported that McAfee's personal fortune had declined to $4 million from a peak of $100 million due to the effect of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 on his investments.[26]

In 2009, McAfee was interviewed in Belize for the CNBC special The Bubble Decade, in which it was reported that he had invested in and/or built many mansions in the USA that went unsold when the 2007 global recession hit. The report also discussed his quest to raise plants for possible medicinal uses on his land in Belize.[31]

In February 2010, McAfee started the company QuorumEx,[32] headquartered in Belize, which aimed to produce herbal antibiotics that disrupt quorum sensing in bacteria.[33][34]

In June 2013, McAfee uploaded a parody video titled How to Uninstall McAfee Antivirus onto his YouTube channel. In it, he critiques the antivirus software while snorting white powder and being stripped by scantily clad women. It received ten million views. He told Reuters the video was meant to ridicule the media's negative coverage of him. A spokesman for McAfee Inc. called the video's statements ""ludicrous"".[35]

Also in 2013, McAfee founded Future Tense Central, which aimed to produce a secure computer network device called the D-Central.[36] By 2016, it was also an incubator.[37]

In February 2014, McAfee announced Cognizant, an application for smartphones, which displays information about the permissions of other installed applications.[38] In April 2014, it was renamed DCentral 1, and an Android version was released for free on Google Play.[39][40]


McAfee at DEF CON 2015
At the DEF CON conference in Las Vegas in August 2014, McAfee warned people not to use smartphones, suggesting apps are used to spy on clueless consumers who do not read privacy user agreements.[41] In January 2016, he became the chief evangelist for security startup Everykey.[37]

In February 2016, McAfee publicly volunteered to decrypt the iPhone used by Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik in San Bernardino, avoiding the need for Apple to build a backdoor.[42] He later admitted that his claims regarding the ease of cracking the phone were a publicity stunt, while still asserting its possibility.[43]

In May 2016, McAfee was appointed chairman and CEO of MGT Capital Investments, a technology holding company. It initially said it would rename itself John McAfee Global Technologies,[44] although this plan was abandoned due to a dispute with Intel over rights to the ""McAfee"" name.[45] He changed MGT's focus from social gaming to cybersecurity, saying ""anti-virus software is dead, it no longer works"", and that ""the new paradigm has to stop the hacker getting in"" before he or she can do damage.[46]

Soon after joining MGT, McAfee said he and his team had exploited a flaw in the Android operating system that allowed him to read encrypted messages from WhatsApp.[47] Gizmodo investigated his claim, and reported that he had sent reporters malware-infected phones to make this hack work. He replied: ""Of course the phones had malware on them. How that malware got there is the story, which we will release after speaking with Google. It involves a serious flaw in the Android architecture.""[48]

McAfee moved MGT into the mining of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, both to make money for the company, and to increase MGT's expertise in dealing with blockchains, which he thought was important for cybersecurity.[49]

In August 2017, McAfee stepped down as CEO, instead serving as MGT's ""chief cybersecurity visionary"". In January 2018, he left the company altogether. Both sides said the split was amicable; he said he wanted to spend all of his time on cryptocurrencies, while the company told of pressure from potential investors to disassociate itself from him.[50]

On 13 August 2018, McAfee took a position of CEO with Luxcore, a cryptocurrency company focused on enterprise solutions.[51]

McAfee was a libertarian, advocating the decriminalization of cannabis, an end to the war on drugs, non-interventionism in foreign policy, a free market economy which does not redistribute wealth, and upholding free trade. He supported abolishing the Transportation Security Administration.[52]

McAfee advocated increased cyber awareness and more action against the threat of cyberwarfare.[53] He pushed religious liberty, saying that business owners should be able to deny service in circumstances that contradict their religious beliefs, adding: ""No one is forcing you to buy anything or to choose one person over another. So why should I be forced to do anything if I am not harming you? It's my choice to sell, your choice to buy.""[54]

On 8 September 2015, McAfee announced a bid for president of the United States in the 2016 presidential election, as the candidate of a newly formed political party called the Cyber Party.[19][55] On 24 December 2015, he re-announced his candidacy bid saying that he would instead seek the presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party.[37][56] On the campaign trail, he consistently polled alongside the party's other top candidates, Gary Johnson and Austin Petersen.[57] The three partook in the Libertarian Party's first nationally televised presidential debate on 29 March 2016.[58] His running mate was photographer, commercial real estate broker and Libertarian activist Judd Weiss.[59]

McAfee came in second in the primaries[60] and third at the 2016 Libertarian National Convention.[61]

Contrary to his assertion at the 2016 convention, McAfee tweeted on 3 June 2018 that he would run for president again in 2020, either with the Libertarian Party or a separate party that he would create.[65] He later chose to run as a Libertarian.[66] He mainly campaigned for wider cryptocurrency use.

On 22 January 2019, McAfee tweeted that he would continue his campaign ""in exile"", following reports that he, his wife, and four campaign staff were indicted for tax-related felonies by the IRS. He said he was in ""international waters"", and had previously tweeted that he was going to Venezuela.[67] The IRS has not commented on the alleged indictments.[68] He defended Communist revolutionary Che Guevara on Twitter, putting himself at odds with Libertarian National Committee chairman Nicholas Sarwark, who wrote, ""I hear very little buzz about McAfee this time around ... making a defense of Che Guevara from Cuba may ingratiate him with the Cuban government, but it didn't resonate well with Libertarians.""[69]

In a tweet on 4 March 2020, McAfee simultaneously suspended his 2020 presidential campaign, endorsed Vermin Supreme, and announced his campaign for the Libertarian Party vice presidential nomination.[70] The next day, he returned to the presidential field, reversing the suspension of his bid, as ""No one in the Libertarian Party Would consider me For Vice President.""[71] The next month, he endorsed Adam Kokesh and became Kokesh's vice-presidential candidate, while still seeking the presidency for himself.[72] At the 2020 Libertarian National Convention, he again lost, now to Jo Jorgensen and Spike Cohen for the presidential and vice-presidential slots.[73]

McAfee contended that taxes were illegal, and claimed in 2019 that he had not filed a tax return since 2010. He referred to himself as ""a prime target"" of the Internal Revenue Service.[74]

In July 2017, McAfee predicted on Twitter that the price of a bitcoin would jump to $500,000 within three years, adding: ""If not, I will eat my own dick on national television.""[75] In July 2019, he predicted a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.[76] In January 2020, he tweeted that his predictions were ""a ruse to onboard new users"", and that bitcoin had limited potential because it is ""an ancient technology.""[77]

McAfee was named a defendant in a 2008 civil court case related to his Aerotrekking light-sport aircraft venture and the death of nephew Joel Bitow and a passenger.[78]

On 30 April 2012, McAfee's property in Orange Walk Town, Belize, was raided by the Gang Suppression Unit of the Belize Police Department. A GSU press release said he was arrested for unlicensed drug manufacturing and possession of an unlicensed weapon.[34][79][80] He was released without charge.[81]

In 2012, Belize police spokesman Raphael Martinez confirmed that McAfee was neither convicted nor charged, only suspected.[82]

In January 2014, while in Canada, he said that when the Belizean government raided his property, it seized his assets, and that his house later burned down under suspicious circumstances.[83]

On 2 August 2015, McAfee was arrested in Henderson County, Tennessee, on one count of driving under the influence and one count of possession of a firearm while intoxicated.[84]

In July 2019, McAfee and members of his entourage were arrested while his yacht was docked at Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, on suspicion of carrying high-caliber weapons and ammunition. They were held for four days and released.[85] Weapons were seized, according to the Public Ministry.[86]

On 11 August 2020, McAfee falsely stated that he was arrested in Norway during the COVID-19 pandemic after refusing to replace a lace thong with a more effective face mask. He later tweeted a picture of himself with a bruised eye, claiming it occurred during this arrest.[87] The photo of the alleged arrest shows an officer with the German word for ""police"" on his uniform, invalidating McAfee's claim of having been arrested in Norway. The Augsburg police later said he tried to enter Germany on that day, but was not arrested.[88]

On 12 November 2012, Belize police began to search for McAfee as a person of interest in connection to the homicide investigation of American expatriate Gregory Viant Faull, who was found dead of a gunshot wound the day before, at his home on the island of Ambergris Caye, the largest island in Belize.[89][90] Faull was a neighbor of McAfee's.[91] In a contemporary interview with Wired,[92] McAfee said he had been afraid police would kill him and refused their routine questions and evaded them.[91] He buried himself in sand for several hours with a cardboard box over his head.[18] Belize's prime minister, Dean Barrow, called him ""extremely paranoid, even bonkers"".[93] He fled Belize rather than cooperate.[94][95][96]

In December 2012, the magazine Vice accidentally gave away McAfee's location at a Guatemalan resort, when a photo taken by one of its journalists accompanying him was posted with the EXIF geolocation metadata still attached.[97]

While in Guatemala, McAfee asked Chad Essley, an American cartoonist and animator, to set up a blog so he could write about his experience while on the run.[98] He then appeared publicly in Guatemala City, where he unsuccessfully sought political asylum.[99]

On 5 December 2012, he was arrested for illegally entering Guatemala. Shortly afterward, the board reviewing his asylum plea denied it and he was taken to a detention center to await deportation to Belize.[100]

On 6 December 2012, Reuters and ABC News reported that McAfee had two minor heart attacks in the detention center and was hospitalized.[101][102] His lawyer said he had no heart attacks, rather high blood pressure and anxiety attacks.[103][104][105] McAfee later said he faked the heart attacks to buy time for his attorney to file a series of appeals that ultimately prevented his deportation to Belize, thus hastening that government's decision to send him back to the United States.[106]

On 12 December 2012, McAfee was released and deported to the United States.[107]

On 14 November 2018, the Circuit Court in Orlando, Florida, refused to dismiss a wrongful death lawsuit against him for Faull's death.[108][109]

In January 2019, McAfee announced that he was on the run from U.S. authorities, and living internationally on a boat following the convening of a grand jury to indict him, his wife, and four of his 2020 Libertarian Party presidential primaries staff on tax evasion charges.[110] At the time, the Internal Revenue Service had not independently confirmed the existence of any such indictment.[110]

On 5 October 2020, McAfee was arrested in Spain at the request of the United States Department of Justice for tax evasion. The June indictment, which was unsealed upon his arrest, alleged he earned millions of dollars from 2014 to 2018, and failed to file income tax returns.[111]

On 6 October, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint further alleging McAfee and his bodyguard promoted certain initial coin offerings (ICOs) in a fraudulent cryptocurrency pump and dump scheme.[112] It claims he presented himself as an impartial investor when he promoted the ICOs, despite allegedly getting paid $23 million in digital assets in return.[112]

On 5 March 2021, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York formally indicted him and an executive adviser on these charges.[113]

McAfee was jailed in Spain, pending extradition to the United States.[113][114]

On 23 June 2021, the Spanish National Court authorized his extradition to face charges in Tennessee;[115][5] McAfee is suspected to have committed suicide several hours after the authorization. The New York extradition case was still pending in a lower Spanish court.[5]

McAfee married three times. He met his first wife circa 1968 while he was working towards a doctorate at Northeast Louisiana State College and she was an undergraduate student.[23] Their affair led to his expulsion from the college.[23] He married his second wife, Judy, a former flight attendant at American Airlines, circa 1987; they divorced in 2002.[23] The night after McAfee arrived in the United States after being deported from Guatemala in December 2012, he was solicited by and slept with Janice Dyson, then a sex worker 30 years his junior in South Beach, Miami Beach, Florida.[116] They began a relationship and married in 2013.[117] She claims that he saved her from human traffickers.[18]

The couple moved to Portland, Oregon, in 2013.[118]

In a 2012 article in Mensa Bulletin, the magazine of the American Mensa, McAfee said developing the first commercial antivirus program had made him ""the most popular hacking target"" and ""[h]ackers see hacking me as a badge of honor"". For his own cybersecurity, he said he had other people buy his computer equipment for him, used pseudonyms for setting up computers and logins, and changed his IP address several times a day.[119] When asked on another occasion if he personally used McAfee's antivirus software, he replied: ""I take it off[...]it's too annoying.""[120]

In 2015, he resided in Lexington, Tennessee.[84] In December 2018, he tweeted that he has ""47 genetic children"".[121][122][123][124] His third wife described him in a Father's Day message as ""father of many, loved by few"".[18]

On 23 June 2021, McAfee was found dead in his prison cell at the Brians 2 Penitentiary Center [ca] near Barcelona, hours after the Spanish National Court ordered his extradition to the United States on criminal charges filed in Tennessee by the United States Department of Justice Tax Division.[5] The Catalan Justice Department said ""everything indicates"" he killed himself by hanging.[11][125][126][127] An official autopsy confirmed his suicide.[128][13]

McAfee's death ignited speculation and conspiracy theories about the possibility that he was murdered. McAfee's death drew comparisons to the circumstances of the death of American financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.[129][130] Several times, McAfee claimed if he were ever found dead by hanging, it would mean he was murdered.[131] Minutes after the report of his death, an image of the letter Q was posted to his Instagram feed (his account was subsequently taken down), apparently in reference to QAnon conspiracy theories.[132][133][134] These theories have been referred to by some journalists as speculative, ""bizarre,"" and ""baseless,"" primarily based on McAfee's own statements.[132][133][134] The day after his death, his lawyer told reporters that while he regularly maintained contact with McAfee in prison, there were no signs of suicidal intent.[135] McAfee's widow reaffirmed this position in her first public remarks since her husband's death, and also called for a ""thorough"" investigation.[136][137]

On 13 February 2022, a Spanish court ruled McAfee died by suicide.[138]

In a Netflix documentary released on August 24, 2022, entitled Running With the Devil: The Wild World of John McAfee, McAfee's ex-girlfriend, identified as Samantha Herrera, alleged that McAfee faked his death to avoid tax evasion charges. This allegation has not been proven, however.[139][140]

Gringo: The Dangerous Life of John McAfee is a Showtime Networks documentary about the portion of McAfee's life spent in Belize. It began airing in September 2016.[141] It covers allegations against him of raping his former business partner, Allison Adonizio, and murdering Belizean David Middleton and American expat Gregory Faull.[142][143] In an interview with Bloomberg's Pimm Fox and Kathleen Hayes on 8 September 2016, he said these incidents were fabricated, and ""Belize is a third-world banana republic and you can go down there and make any story you want if you pay your interviewees, which Showtime did.""[144][145]

In March 2017, it was reported that Glenn Ficarra and John Requa would direct a film about McAfee titled King of the Jungle, written by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. At various points, Johnny Depp, Michael Keaton, and Seth Rogen were reported to have taken roles and later to have left the project. In November 2019, Zac Efron was reported to star as journalist Ari Furman.[146][147][148][149]

On 12 May 2017, McAfee and his wife were interviewed on ABC News's 20/20 regarding Faull's alleged murder.[150]

The aforementioned documentary Running With the Devil: The Wild World of John McAfee includes footage from an unreleased documentary by Vice, and interviews by Rocco Castoro, Alex Cody Foster, and Robert King.[151]

I really like this in principle- I remember discussing this with Max on twitter a few weeks ago. That said, the prop needs to be WAAAAAAAAAY more thought out and clear about the impact, locations, billboard design, etc. before I'd feel comfortable saying yes. It's not a great look to have the discourse post be more comprehensive than the actual on chain prop.
That said, I pass these digital bus stops every day and they're very definitely a worthwhile investment based on my own lived experience; the prop needs to be fixed though

Would make more sense to do this when there‚Äôs a conference like NFT.NYC.

Notes from Nouncil calls:
- The prop lacks details and seems a bit vague.
- This seems so top of funnel that we can't measure success at the core product level.
- If there was a product focussed call to action it would be an easy yes. Anchoring to consumer goods like Nouns Coffee for example could have a much higher impact.",157,Against,"‚åê ‚ó® ‚ó®

**JoshuaFisher**
I‚Äôm fine with this but also Like the barrier being 2 because it is a self selecting benefit in terms of how much time do they spend in the community. If you can‚Äôt get 2 Nouns then maybe not ready to go on-chain imho.

**JoelCares**
A 1 Noun threshold to submit proposals for the first 1000 Nouns feel reasonable to me.

**andreitr**
The existing threshold is a feature that reduces noise.

**fiveoceans_dev**
I also, agree to keep the threshold growing. It will make smaller stake holders to work together and in turn help coordinate against potential malicious activities by individual big stake holders

**kerimbonia**
Also in agreement that lowering the threshold will introduce more noise and with all the changes going on in the nouns ecosystem i'm not sure this is the best time for it.

**mintface.eth**
I lean towards a single Noun so that proposals get seen and evaluated. 
2 Nouns min creates a three party negotiation to take something on-chain. Two parties are then seen to 'endorse' or at a min be associated with proposer.
The idea of acquire a Noun and propose is cool.

**CHEFFO ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**
i think that the current system is healthy and not needing a change

**samellis ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®**
Drop the threshold, good ideas will rise, especially with the changes of gas reimbursement and the more than likely time extension, why put an additional ‚Äúpay to play‚Äù barrier. Let folks come in with their ideas.

**Benbodhi**
Only just over a year until it would increase again.
The barrier to entry to buy a noun is significant and the ability to submit a prop after purchasing a noun is something I feel should be possible.
I know delegation and sponsorship is a thing, but I‚Äôm thinking of lone actors.
Not sure it makes a huge difference in prop quality.

**Toady_Hawk**
I agree with reducing to one noun threshold. We don‚Äôt have a proposal spam problem yet (which is why this feature was baked in) so I think it makes sense to lower it to encourage more participation. Last time this was proposed (with a long time period attached that muddied the waters) it was all the brand new Nouners voting yes, which I think was telling. Keep in mind if spam ever became a problem, another proposal could easily raise the threshold again.

**lil bk**
all in favor of reducing the threshold to propose. entry of barrier to hold a noun is high as is. 

there‚Äôs a total of 292 unique noun owners and thus don‚Äôt think spam would be an issue. instead, it‚Äôll increase the overall probability to proliferate/propose in the first place. if my counting is correct, there theoretically is only 58 people who can propose as it stands (holding 2 nouns)

**kerimbonia**
i'm on the fence with this one but starting to lean towards yes the more we chat about it. 
i def agree that anybody buying a noun should be able to put a proposal on-chain and that the cream of proposals will always rise to the top... that might sway my vote (no) concerning added noise to proposals and the additional time investment needed for voters/nouncil to discuss and filter through all of those to give each one the attention they deserve to get. i also think there is something very community about somebody with a noun having to reach out to another to get a proposal on-chain... anyways, still thinking about all this.",159,Against,"‚åê ‚ó® ‚ó® nouncil vote

I almost exclusively vote no on all props for physical advertising campaigns. I think afk/irl advertising with merch etc doesn‚Äôt actually make anyone interested in a project. Especially at events that are filled with advertisements and tons of companies i domt think it makes sense for the huge amounts of money required. I think the money is always spent better on either digital art or software since they can reach everyone with no costs and doesnt produce things like tshirts that get very small use and then thrown away
I think afk/irl stuff should be very limited and done when they have a strong value and are innovative in some way or help people in some way (like the glasses donated to children)

Juan ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®
a bit confused as to what content & efforts Stoopid Buddy is doing vs OTG, aren't we already shooting tons of footage?

Also, it seems to me that the big media draw is going to be the parade float, not the t-shirts and stickers thrown out along the route.

andrewladdusaw
Interesting take. My first thought was no as well until I saw the numbers of items and people that plan to get out. I'm actually for this now because if we're already in on the float and the documentary, why wouldn't we want to attempt to maximize as much as possible? I do like where your head is at with it though.

profwerder
This is a big YES for me! This isn‚Äôt just about an event‚Äî-this is TONS of content that will be used for YEARS to come! We should seek out every way to bolster this opportunity and maximize it. 

For the amount of FREE advertising this event will get  Nouns, this is a small ask.

Over the past week, I have heard of at least 6-7 people anecdotally in my circles with plans to use the builder imminently for various projects and I think it can play a really important role as a ""1-click-align-with-nouns"" tool, especially when paired with Prop House mandates and strategic builder funding going forward.

I recommend we vote No on this proposal because Nouns Builder is early in its lifecycle and I haven't seen much firm information on the charter or direction for Nouns Builder DAO in regards to what its treasury should be used for aside from generalize-able Nounish tooling. At the same time, the new Nouns Builder DAO would have a risk of fund extraction. Even though a veto power exists, this power comes with a coordination cost if secured correctly. Having a large ""imbalance"" between the auction proceeds and the DAO's treasury early on in the process feels dangerous to me.

I'd be amenable if this were a smaller initial seed, the NounsDAO were to follow on by amplifying proposals/prop-house rounds/grant pools/etc. after the Nouns Builder DAO is formed, or the NounsDAO were to purchase Nouns Builder DAO votes during the auction.


9999:
Thanks to Zora for effort and dedication to building with Nouns. I‚Äôm voting against because I feel this proposal and Builder DAO itself need refinements before an ask of this size. My concerns are these:

If this tool truly needs to be a DAO the market will signal as such using the auction price of its governing NFTs. Just like all other Nounish DAOs, Builder should grow its community and treasury from natural demand and develop its ecosystem with people who understand its vision.

If the tool is not meant to be a DAO, then with no proven track-record, the ask for 1000ETH to jump-start demand is overkill. All other large scale, long-term projects/pods have started small and demonstrated demand before asking for outsized funding (See [Prop House Protocol: Public Infrastructure by Nouns DAO](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/prop-house-protocol-public-infrastructure-by-nouns-dao/1594) as cited in this proposal). Builder currently has no metrics to match the size of this ask.

The Zora team should decide which approach to take. If the former, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to come to Nouns DAO for a treasury injection. If the latter, the project should first gather momentum before an ask of this size can be considered a hell yes. Thanks again.",167,Against,"devcarrot

""I'm still not 100% on where I land on this. All my previous comments still stand on my belief in the tool and the team. I still think it's going to be  game changer. I originally told them I thought a huge retro should be offered for a free tool, but that amount in my mind was like 250. When you factor the audit costs they referenced as well, I'd be closer to 350-400. Admittedly, I have no idea what things cost in the tech world, but I'd like to see this ask be 40-50% of what it is now with Nouns supporting it further later on if it's found to be providing outsized value.""

Further, Zora got $50M to build tooling - they should be seeking subscriptions for their tools, not one-offs.""

1. i don‚Äôt love the precedent it sets around managing treasury funds. i see no reason that withdrawing 500 ETH from the treasury and converting it to 750k USDC in advance is helpful in procuring a partnership with mr. beast. it exposes the treasury to volatility risk for something that is low probability, and placing this much capital in a 2/3 multisig without a compelling reason to do so is a bad practice. 

2. while this proposal increases the probability that people will attempt to form partnerships with mr. beast, it also decreases the probability that he will accept these partnership offers. in the worst case, the large bounty on solicitation could lead to undesirable sales tactics, and preclude the possibility of future partnerships. guerrilla tactics are helpful when the dao and its potential partners have little to lose, but will be less effective when attempting to partner with celebrities with large audiences who are sensitive to reputation risk, especially when the offer is coming from a strange entity like a DAO. a gentle introduction from a trusted mr. beast associate is probably the most likely road to a productive and long term relationship

I am a no on this specific proposal strictly because of the funding mechanisms and structure.  I think the layout is a bit too vague on guidelines for the public + how we will get this message outside of the Nouns bubble (i.e. Aubtoshi would be a fantastic face for this on socials for announcing it etc.).  This IS a fantastic idea and has sparked some amazing conversations in Nouncil and Twitter Space rooms within the community.  

My main worry is: 
1) We have no control over what people will do for $250k.  I see a ton of wonderful things happening here but also see how the 1% of people could really hurt the reputation of Nouns IRL via some dumb ploy to get Mr. Beast's attention.  Again, love the concept, maybe we can lay this out with some stricter guides.

2) I would double the 500 to giveaway/make a video.  Mr. Beast is getting so much money right now and we are technically an NFT collection (no matter how much good we do or how much we think he would love Nouns, which I THINK he would).

This all being said, I thank you all for taking the time to think of this cool concept and would love to see another iteration of this!  Would be great for Nouns and cool to see all of the Nounish things people do!

Since winning that round (2 ETH), I have seen him work so hard to set up and roll out the .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®  network and identities that many of us love and use every day. 

He has also reached out to every corner of the nouniverse to make sure .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® is natively resolved almost anywhere you want to interact, from nouns.wtf and Agora to basically any nounish auction site you can think of.

Phase 2 is all about proliferation of the .nouns (NNS) network and I think the planned 3-pronged approach of 1) continuing to integrate more communities to resolve . ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® natively, 2) running social media campaigns and the Nounish Club initiative to make nns names more desirable and 3) seeding/spinning up a DAO with Nouns builder to create a flywheel of community proliferation using Prop House and other methods to reward community members who help spread the .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® meme, is a powerful strategy to get as many nounish people as possible using this network daily (and therefore proliferating nouns across web3.)

- Inefficient capital allocation
The prop asks for 65Œû to allocate 10Œû, a ~90% admin overhead.

- Non-scalable approach
The approach appears to revolve around ""consulting"" services that are very manually intensive and do not scale, unless we want to employ a small army of consultants at the DAO like a Deloitte, Ernst & Young, PwC, KPMG, etc.

- Unnecessary creation of static website tools
We should lean into automated tools like Prop House or AddressBoard. Information repositories already exist in the form of Nouns Center, which is already linked to from the main Nouns website.

- Unclear outcomes or measurements of success
How is success being measured here? What benchmarks would need to be hit so we can decide if we want to fund an effort like this again (or clone it in other areas)?

I encourage the team to discuss this with the builder community and come back with a prop that addresses the broader concerns raised on their efforts.

While I like the enthusiasm and appreciate the team's effort to put this forth, the proposed outcomes feel vague. If the end goal is to get builders funded - I'd much rather see the team pursue a small amount of funding to run their own grants program. This way, it is much easier to measure success while also allowing the team to find/consult with builders.

9999:
The team is passionate and well placed to execute on this idea. I think it‚Äôs reasonable to get funds to test out a consultancy/incubator on a small scale, but I dislike subsidizing this entirely for 3 months when there‚Äôs an obvious business model. 
In general, I am for the consultancy model and believe it can bring qualified builders to the DAO. To that end, the market has the ability to signal whether the PropBox idea/team/approach works and funding to the extent requested would distort this process.
In addition to reducing the timeline and funding amount, I would recommend voting for this proposal if it had target metrics: 1 month, interface with 10-15 builders, target 1-2 amazing on-chain proposal, include a ‚Äúfinders fee‚Äù to subsidize the funding gap.

devcarrot:
I agree with the other Nounders that there should be a market for this type of advising that takes the form of a ""finders fee"" or ""tip"". I would like to see this proposal changed to either include more discrete objectives or, as Aubtoshi mentioned, expanded to be a source of earlier funding.

one of the main reasons i decided to stick around the nouniverse after striking out with my first few prop house entries is the reception i received from the people on this team. they welcomed me into the community and invested in me as a builder by helping me work through my original proposal. 

i'd never had an experience like that in a community before. and it made me want to dig in and keep building cool shit here. i don't know if i'd still be working in the nouniverse if it wasn't for this team.

i'm voting yes on this because i believe new (and old) builders will benefit from having this team focused and dedicated to guide them through the proposal process. which in turn will benefit the dao with better and more successful projects.

**heyjeff.eth** | *""looks super dope - just voted yes*""

**CHEFFO ‚åê‚óß-‚óß** | *""This looks great. Again we are starting to see props where groups of OG nounish builders are using the established vibes and channels to start to bring in other talent...in a creatively managed way. This is one of the future styles of onboarding that needs to be experimented with and doubled down on now.*

*One of the best ways to proliferate will be to create lore. Lore allows for creative growth, story telling and IRL experience  marketing.*

*The prop also does a good job of fund allocation/re-allocation. The budget is correct and relatively speaking could drive engagement on a much higher level than other items in this range.*

*The team is pro and will do a great job of finding and working with talent. Incorporating Prop House is also a good way to open the build and utilize and promote one of the strongest tools in the eco.
CHEFFO = YES*""

If any proposal NEEDS the votes of the proposer, or anyone that benefits from it to pass, it should not pass.

In order to make better decisions and to avoid conflicts of interest it would be good for the DAO if the social consensus was for the proposer to abstain with any votes or delegated votes if the proposal benefits them in any way.

The default for everyone else should be to vote no IF a proposer does vote for their own proposal that serves their interest. 

If a large voting block enforced this, it would become the social norm instantly. And we already have some social contracts on votes that are enforced (ie vote down any prop less than 20e in size to better scale on-chain prop flow) or have been suggested on other matters i.e https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1600506671436300288",181,Abstain,"create proposal financially benefit way abstain

**CHEFFO ‚åê‚óß-‚óß** | *""This is a very interesting prop. Touching on product design, event planning, community building, in Paris none the less. A true intersection of art, culture and tech. That is 100% Nounish.*

*It is interesting to read back through the first two props on the Roadmap. Very cool to see the project laid out in stages, solidify itself and steadily work to this point. DAO support of the project completion cycle is fundamentally important. That does not mean with out discussion.*

*Including the 30 NFT Paris event tickets is smart and hopefully will line up with other nounish things going on. I think it will be a key event for Nouns in Europe. People have been talking about it for months. This project can begin to solidify nouns as a fashion incubator. The press opportunities are tremendous. The on-boarding is tremendous. Paris is one of the best locations to potentially on-board affluent buyers who would be capable of joining the DAO.*

*Event planning is very time intensive and requires major planning and organization. Nothing is cheap. Nouns should grasp the opportunities that are presenting themselves to engage with focused and excited audiences.*

*Curious what the next steps could be after the event, but I think the artist and team is motivated and will be equip with excellent assets and display materials for on-going proliferation.*

*CHEFFO = YES""*

**RyanMac ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®** | *""Nouns having a delgated email address per owner to use for on-chain activity is a great idea""* 

**ChrisCoCreated** | *""anything that helps people flex their noun adds value""*

**Graphic.‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®** | *""would be a great way to communicate with one another and like everyone business it would be cool for nouns to have there own üòÉ""*

**bradq** | *""This seems like an interesting idea but I'm not convinced there is need for it. And I think Nouners only is too narrow a focus. This idea for a couple hundred active Nouners max, and probably far less doesn't seem to make sense. Appreciate the builders and effort, though.""* 

**Mach** | *""Novel idea but don't think the use case is that widespread that it's something that should be funded like this. Limited scope and small chance for adoption""*

**Josep** | *""I do not think it is the best way to add value to the DAO to allocate this amount of resources to a service that I doubt will become the primary form of communication in Nouns DAO, which is why I am against funding this project.""*

**Blu ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®** | *""So looking at this, Skiff still run their own servers but messages are encrypted so they don‚Äôt have access which could be an issue. If skiff gets shut down though then emails don‚Äôt work. Wish something like this could merge with handshake to make it truly decentralized. That being said I voted for it to see what they come up with since it‚Äôs a great idea.""*

**Benbodhi** | *""I love the concept and tech but feel like it won't get a lot of use, especially with the limited subset of users that are interested noun holders.
It also seems har to evaluate the work involved. Looks like the build is a token gated claim for custom domain and frontend interface for claim, which if this is the full development requirement, seems like it's possibly overpriced.*
*Unfortunately I have to vote no on this proposal as it is.""*

**Mindtoasted** | *""Love the idea, an exclusive email address. I think the request is quite big in my opinion, but still curious about what will happen if this idea goes on chain. I would like to vote yes on this.""*

**0xDariush** | *""i don't see any demands for this in the ecosystem, at least at the moment. or maybe I'm not nerd enough to get it""*

*- no re-skins; encourage native solutions to native problems are encouraged*
*- established forms of communication such as Twitter, Farcaster, and DIscord suffice. hence voters don't see a reason to invest in another one. atleast for now""*

**.ZllW ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®** | *""Don't really see a demand for this tool""*

**pemburux** | *""Agreed you all, with 29 ETH for the current state we can promote Nouns even more""*

**byhardy** | *""Cool concept, not sure it would get used or if there is a fit here. Don't love proposals that don't support wider Nounish ecosystem of non-holders. To this end, the prop feels a bit tone deaf. The prop does not even mention delegates, but the prop is from a delegate themselves?* 

*I do think both skiff and this prop are on the right track, but they should adapt to accomodate other builders in the Nouns ecosystem (and delegates) who don't own a Noun yet.""*

**andreitr** | *""Voting against this because it does not benefit the broader Nounish community nor does it help proliferate the Noun meme.""*

**RyanMac ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®** | *""great resource for nounders to always stay connected & up to date on the ecosystem""* 

**0xDariush** | *""targeting only nouns holders is not nounish enough.*

*We have 340 holders atm and at this early stage even if 30% of them gonna use it it's going to be like a small gathering.""*

**BENJAMIN LATSKO ‚åê‚óß-‚óß** | *""cute but no. nouners dont even buy nouns tshirts""*

**Benbodhi** | *""I'd like to see this as a nouniverse platform rather than just nouners, I think there'd be a larger userbase and it would be more valuable then.""*

**Mach** | *""not a fan of the presented concept. Maybe a better proof of concept could sway me in future, but the project is potentially dead on arrival. Nouns risks spreading itself too thin over hundreds of communities, websites, and forums to continue funding more""*

**Mindtoasted** | *""I want to vote no on this, why? indeed there are many useful features in this proposal, do not forget to also see how punksclub runs. I think if it can only be used by nouners that's great, but it could be even crazier if all the sub-communities could participate in this, connecting various sub communities who are active in their respective fields. Really love the idea but I have to vote No.""*

**Classic_Craig** | *""I love what NounsOTG is doing irl and on social. with a robust 2023 outline, I believe it can be one of the top visibility gainers of the next few years!""*

**JackWyldes** | *""I like the idea behind this proposal but I don't think there is enough to show from the original 6 months content wise to provide me with the confidence in everything they plan to do.  I strongly believe in OTG proliferation and content creation so I am a little conflicted.""* 

**BENJAMIN LATSKO ‚åê‚óß-‚óß** | *""not scalable. recommended an alternative prop: craft an IRL activation playbook""*

**JoshuaFisher** | *""couldnt imagine not giving this team the tools request to keep going""*

**Benbodhi** | *""nounish af ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®""*

**nonodynamo** | *""I think that it is important to have an in-person presence at events. The impact is not just in the secondary media after the fact it is at the event itself.  Nouns On The Ground give a connection to the community as a whole.""* 

**Blu ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®** | *""Nouns OTG is about building friendships & connecting us all üíô we need that.""*

**Mach** | *""cost is too high with little deliverables, no quantification of impact, majority non impact events. No concrete goals to propel nouns forward.""*

**pin.pusher** | *""""Aubtoshi is the best but don‚Äôt tell her"" - Toady Hawk from OTG Discord""*

**profwerder** | *""There is an extensive amount of organization for events and event travel. We do need a go to person who can not only carry out events but as a contact for other IRL opportunities that might present itself. Decentralization is a feature and a bug. Sometimes we need those ambassadors who can help bring others in while proliferating and Aubtoshi does this extremely well. This should not prohibit other approaches but this type of outreach is vital at this early stage of the DAO.""*

**kerimbonia** | *""Yes Yes Yes... a nouns presence at all of the events proposed with a nouns community member that has showed nothing but passion for proliferating nouns is a no-brainer yes from me. the budget is definitely in line with the ambitious roadmap as well... gl aubtoshi!""*

**RobotFishGirl** | *""the best written and most valuable prop in awhile""*

**andreitr** | *""I was initially skeptical about including so many events into a single proposal but after talking to Aubtoshi and seeing how much time and effort went into planning this I changed my mind. Voting yes because NounsOTG has a proven track record and having a year-long events plan makes sense.""*

**Coral Orca** | *""aubtoshi is nounish""*

**systemdm.‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®** | *""Absolut yes from me. I think the work @aubtoshi  - Nouns on the Ground has been doing is amazing.  Strongly believe in the power of IRL events to proliferate beyond the NFT bubble..which is  what its all about IMO.. üëçüèª""*

**Mindtoasted** | *""Absolute yes from me, I like the things that Nouns On The Ground is doing irl, Its very Nounish and proven concrete.""*

**RyanMac ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®** | *""ETH price at time of prop posting was $1,330 with the 10% buffer @570 ETH this would be $758,100 (not the listed $623,986). Now, with ETH on the rise, the USDC cost of this prop is $885,100.*

*That‚Äôs a 42% difference ($261,114) from the USDC price that is listed in the proposal $623,986*

*The proposer should resubmit with a USDC ask since the DAO added a system to pay in USDC for these volatile market situations. Also, who are the other 2-3 members of the NOTG team? The lack of information about the other 2-3 team members & there duties is alarming.""*

feedback and concerns

I'm voting Yes after taking it all in.

My rationale:
-This is a differentiated experimental model for branded Nounish goods.  If it proves successful, it's replicable. (Nouns Whisky minted at 500 

barrels per year, entirely different products, etc)
-102 ETH is 2-3 days of auctions today at a local nadir, < 1% of our annual runrate. The cost isn't particularly high.
-This will return ETH no matter what, so the ETH cost is less than 102 stated.
-Andre is real and it's a thoughtful plan even given concerns that can be raised.  Will be on them to deliver and execute in Year 3, not just Year 

0.
-I will absolutely buy this product and probably know a bunch of people who would, so there's PMF.
-The NFT angle with the branded product is a good one, has life and adds legs.  Owning a barrel over time is an experiential good, and something 

you can do with a group of friends.
-Plays with commitments and ventures over longer time frames than most DAOs do or would.  We are oriented to the long term uniquely.  We expect to 

be around in 2026 and in 2036 and in 2069.",208,For,"encourage consider look 87Bones commentary Jungle Discord expertise industry useful

Im a big proponent of nounsdao funding public goods, especially in the software/crypto/ethereum domain, so on the one hand, i love this initiative.

I believe nounsdao is better off in a world where voting comes with some social pressure to take responsibility and publicly stand behind voting decisions. I acknowledge social pressure also swings the other way (relationship costs, nepotism, etc) but Im willing to make that tradeoff vs cold, faceless PvP.

there's a view that privacy is all about wanting ""secrecy"" and that it is a cloak that only the cowardly or the malicious want to put on to hide their shenanigans.

this view imo misses the real social issues real humans experience when voting completely transparently.

for example, once you get to know someone or some team it's hard to vote against a prop they put up even if you don't think they are the right person / team for the project (or don't agree with the aim of the project entirely) b/c it feels like you're rejecting them and that social pressure creates a social relationship cost to voting honestly (biasing towards voting yes or not voting).

another example is if you know you're going to put up your own prop soon or a contentious prop you care a lot about is coming up soon. in that case, you need to maintain friendly relationships with as much of the voter base as possible. voting your conscience in props leading up to the prop you want to win creates a real opportunity cost to voting honestly.

note that in both of these examples the voter is not trying to screw over the protocol public. they are an honest actor that simply would prefer to vote honestly for selfless reasons but the social costs or the opportunity costs of doing so lead them to vote (in the worst case) dishonestly.

I'm totally open to the possibility that ultimately the benefits of full transparency can outweigh the benefits of privacy and we can as a community decide to maintain the status quo.

but I would like to have the conversation before dismissing it out of fear. and we can't really have a concrete conversation if we don't know what's even possible. this round imo is a step to find that out.",216,For,"disagree nounder

Aren‚Äôt you VC-backed?
Yes, we are. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve geared this prop to deliver an entirely open-source, openly owned codebase ‚Äî so there is no centralized value capture, and anyone can host, build on top of, and monetize the end deliverables. We think this completely aligns incentives and will help build a strong, open ecosystem.

What does open sourcing mean here?
This means everything from the repo to the APIs will be open access, so people with varying levels of technical acumen can clone and re-host and build on top of House of Nouns. We‚Äôll also be doing continual data dumps to Arweave for any offchain data.

Budget?
While ETH is going up in price, we‚Äôve decreased our prop‚Äôs total cost by ~$100k. We heavily increased deliverables and the speed at which we deliver them. We‚Äôre looking for 9ETH/month/developer, which is less than any other active developers for Nouns. We think that deliverables and actual matter the most, and think they are very justifiable for the cost of 190ETH in terms of the long-term impact they can have on the DAO‚Äôs success.

Integrations?
We‚Äôre looking to be as open and composable as possible. We want to integrate the amazing work of others everywhere it makes sense, versus create clones and replicate any functionality. We want to be a bridge between the disjoint governance infrastructure in the ecosystem.

It went ok but it hasn't left our bubble yet and the community around it is pre-traction.  As a platform, it's very early and doesn't exist yet.  It doesn't warrant big spending (yet), it's still very much at the experiment level.  It's on this team to prove out much more before it's worth funding more.  It doesn't make sense for the DAO to take experiments and 5x or 10x the funding unless there's strong evidence that it was a clear win.  If this was ""continue to explore Noun Sounds"" and 50 ETH +  20 ETh for a CC0 music Prop House rounds, there'd be something to debate, but after this ask and the strategy, I'd lean No there.

There is serious issues here with strategy and not understanding that the partnerships with these famous musicians are not only very expensive marketing for a platform that isn't ready for it but also a poor fit for how to build a real organic CC0 focused music community of any kind.  You need people, small people, passionate people who vibe organically and don't need to be paid to vibe.  Find those people, engage them with Noun Sounds, build Noun Sounds and its community with them.  Money doesn't spend for that.

When Proposers are getting paid by the DAO in other places, it's helpful and important to lay that out upfront.  The DAO deserves to know, the relationship is already so assymetrical, I expect our partners to be clear and WANT the DAO to be informed.  

I'd also want to see Proposals be transparent when they have relationships with entities they are funding in the Proposal itself.  It would help to know that Woody has a relationship with Save the Music -- it means that execution there is more likely to go more smoothly.  It's also important because the DAO should know when there's the potential for related party transactions. It's small dollars here so it doesn't matter as much right now but STM was also was mentioned in that this team expects funding for future STM proposals, so understanding that relationship is important.  It also highlights the lack of cohesion and focus here -- STM future proposals for even more money but also focusing on expensive celebrity marketing but also working on a pre-traction platform that will live and die by passionate CC0 creators that are not either of the first 2 groups is an odd admixture.",225,Against,"Nouns Sounds unanimous small experiment clear set deliverable   go ok leave bubble community pre traction   platform early exist   warrant big spending experiment level   team prove worth fund   sense dao experiment 5x 10x funding strong evidence clear win   continue explore Noun Sounds 50 eth +   20 eth CC0 music Prop House round debate ask strategy lean

Running twitter spaces (or a media company) at a cost of over $1m a year ‚Äì taking the metrics given in the prop itself, doesn‚Äôt add up for me. $1m+ a year is an absolutely massive amount of money for something like this. 

When we try and gauge how TNS is doing I think we should look at the flagship NOC show as a barometer of performance‚Ä¶the flagship show should be just that. The data for this specific show should be fairly clear but It isn‚Äôt. It seems to get <100 people on it.

I do think Toady is genuinely trying to build a Nounish media company BUT at the same time I do not think that it is working in its current format nor can it bring value anywhere near what is being spent under the current model or the one proposed in the prop. 

The core team on TNS consists of 8 people. 6 of these members works together over multiple projects and between those 6 people they will have received somewhere between $4.5 and $5m in funding if these proposal pass. This isn‚Äôt to pass judgement on anything here apart from to say it‚Äôs a lot money for a team that all work together (in tns, nouncil, uglydao). It just is to illustrate the points above, to show there is a focus outside of tns too from the core team and to warn against the centralization of all media control among any team. 

TNS has a place in Nouns and I think Toady should be funded for TNS. But it should have a clear focus on its main show - Nouns O Clock. All efforts should be singularly directed on building up that show, getting an audience inside and outside nouns. It should have a much smaller core team and a budget of around 100-150k (which is a lot of money to build a spaces or podcast on top of the 600k already received!)

Before we talk about building a media company let‚Äôs focus on doing that one thing and one thing well.

Mistakes happen, I have compassion for that.  But if we knew we had to buy 30k comics for $150k then, it's possible the DAO would have voted differently given this would have increased the all-in cost by 50%.

As is, the evidence that there is demand for 30k comics isn't easily observable.  Why 5k and not 2k per issue?  After the original proposal was off, need more clarity and confidence to double down and buy our own comic.  Nounders voted No to a 10k toy run for Nounish Friends with unique composable figures by Klim and the rationale was that these would sit in a warehouse and that was cheaper than the comics proposal all-in.  How is there 3x demand for this at a higher cost to the DAO?

At $5/comic, that feels like we are paying retail prices for a wholesale relationship.  The explanation provided doesn't square for me.  We are bearing the full risk with no upside. There are live sites right now to buy these comics $3.5-4 at retail.  It's a discrepancy that stands out.

If this is needed to be effective at Comicon(s) or to issue well, it should have been brought to the DAO before the last minute end of their February deadline.  Being rushed is suboptimal.

Infrastructure exploration is highly risky and uncertain. It is harder than imagined. But the team has a good track record to prove that they have a deep understanding and patience for it.

Our opposition mainly comes from:
1. Is it too early to do it now? 
Nounish Dataverse may be like Web3 Social projects, unable to find Builders to develop products/tools that everyone needs, infrastructure but running applications that no one uses on top. 

There is no information indicating that applications currently in demand (Prop House, Nouns Agora, House of Nouns, Nouns.Build, Dune Dashboard..) would consider using Ceramic as their data backend. It is much more difficult for applications to be demanded than to do underlying infrastructure. Holding a Prop House Round as mentioned in the proposal does not solve this problem.

2. The proposal delivers too much content

The House Of Nouns proposal is one that is difficult to find flaws in.

We have two concerns:

1. NounsDAO has no ownership of the product that the proposal promises. Will the ownership of the product, as promised in the proposal, be allocated to NounsDAO? If there is no correlation, then the funds requested in the proposal are essentially for the team to develop a product that belongs solely to themselves using NounsDAO's funds. This is a proposal that harms Nouns and benefits the team.

2. Complexity of features. The product promises to implement a complete governance lifecycle, including collecting ideas, early-stage discussions, on-chain decisions, etc. This means that the functional requirements are complex, and once the complexity is identified, even the best product manager will find it difficult to handle.

First concern is not an issue with the 242 proposal, but rather with the immaturity of the NounsDAO system itself.

Overall, we like the House Of Nouns product and team for the following reasons:

1. We are frequent users of House Of Nouns. It is simple and has redesigned the user interaction logic to focus on proposals, rather than channels, communities, or governance participants. This is a new type of product, and it has been well received by users (we can attest to that).

2. House Of Nouns is the first governance tool to define a complete governance process, implying a standard for proposal governance. It is beneficial not only for NounsDAO but also for the Nounish and Crypto industry, as it promotes scientific and standardized governance.

3. House Of Nouns has an excellent product team behind it. They understand the Nouns spirit and have developed a new Nouns model product called thatsgnarly.ly. Behind House Of Nouns and ThatsGnarly's products, one can see a professional and continuous product development system, which is invaluable.",242,Abstain,"imagine world voting exist world need rule principle world voting reality simple rule vote use Squad Vote proposal people vote vote abstain vote chain abstain rule

3. This is an interesting governance experiment. PropLot will become Nounish's wish pool, and if it becomes a reality, it would be too wonderful! Both Nouners could enjoy a more complete governance cycle and a more active ecosystem.

However, there are many concerns. The reason for these concerns is that
1. PropLot's effectiveness in NounsDAO is in doubt. PropLot performs well in the Lilnouns community due to its member size and its integration into the lilnouns website. 
But PropLot and NounsDAO are very different. NounsDAO is a network with only 341 holders (NounsDAO is not a community), while Lilnouns has a community of 2338 active members who generate many interesting stories on Discord. 
In addition, if PropLot is not integrated into the NounsDAO website or the processes of Prop House or House Of Nouns, then there will be little interaction with holders and users. Although Nouns.Center has implemented this feature, its entry point is too deep, and no one uses it. These are the reasons why we do not believe PropLot will be successfully adopted in NounsDAO.

2. There are also many alternative products available. PropLot's idea is simple and can easily be implemented by HouseOfNouns (in their proposal) or other products such as nouns.build and nounsagora.

Supporting Points:
1. Atrium has proven their production capability. With a previous proposal, they delivered a remarkable 2-minute video with impressive speed and content, standing out from previous video proposals with poor delivery in NounsDAO.
2. Atrium's video is relatively cost-effective compared to other high-quality videos.

Opposing Points:
1. For the same cost, ten meme shorts could have better reach. Nouns should focus on storytelling and creating memes  instead of high-quality.
2. Proposal 195 video fails to demonstrate the team's storytelling ability. There are no memes or compelling stories, and there is no motivation for secondary creation and propagation.

According to the ‚Äúsquad vote‚Äù result for proposal 241, which is 5 for, 18 against and 0 abstain, we choose to vote against.

The proposal's opinion is clear, and we do not recommend taking Rage Quit immediately. It's not just an issue with the content of the proposal itself, but also the caution regarding the level of the proposal.

Our opposing viewpoints:

1. Refuse to change the constitutional-level rules of the DAO without evidence that Rage Quit is effective (MolochDAO rarely uses Rage Quit) or sufficient community debate. Proposals of this level require lengthy debate, repeated proposals and opposition, and then approval. Changing the underlying rules lightly is irresponsible to the consensus. It is normal for a system to have human flaws at every level. However, a casual attitude towards underlying rules could destroy the Nouns system, a stable system is better than no system.
2. NounsDAO already has a secondary market exit method. Rage Quit is a term that appears powerful on the surface, but in essence, it is a bad price market-making way. It does not have the game-theoretical effect it promises.
3. The importance behind Rage Quit is not angry, but forking. The execution of this proposal did not enhance the system or generate more viable branches, but resulted in a loss of consensus, which is negative on the margin. Instead, leaving feedback for continuous improvement of the system can turn it into a way to enhance the system. The efficiency of Nouns proposal supervision has also been improving and will continue to progress.
4. The proposal implies that everyone is angry, which is a language game. The fact is that most users have a mixed feeling of disappointment and hope. Any one-sided release of hope or anger will damage a system.
5. Earlier proposal 192 had a more comprehensive rage quit design called theDAO Split mechanism/design. The proposer, Verbs team, pointed out that although it is still under discussion with legal counsel, they believe it is the best solution for Nouns. They are now soliciting community opinions and think it is very urgent to implement it as soon as possible.

The supporting viewpoints for this proposal are very simple:
1. Promote the equal vision of Nouns: Each Nouns subdao represents Nouns, and NounsDAO is just one branch.

A key risk is that rage quit risks a stifling of treasury funds. Each treasury activation / funding grant would at least temporarily lower the book value of Nouns, so holders are faced with a trade-off every time they vote on a proposal: fund the prop vs. preserve the book value of their Noun. In theory, this creates a forcing function for better evaluating the merits of each prop ‚Äì only props which are believed to drive future value to the DAO in excess of the current book value of each Noun would pass. In practice, that‚Äôs hard to quantify proactively. The consequence could be fewer funding approvals, especially for more provocative experiments that may not have as explicit financial returns. 

We recognize that, even if this proposal is defeated, it‚Äôs likely not the last time we‚Äôll see a rage quit proposal submitted to the Nouns DAO. In light of this, it‚Äôs worth taking a moment to revisit some of what makes Nouns special:


The ability to activate funds for bold, unique experiments in brand and community building
Highly engaged community members
A consistent source of funding (the daily auction)

Any implementation of rage quit should seek to preserve those core primitives. 4156 has already proposed one alternative mechanism, whereby any Nouner who votes but lands in the minority on a proposal can rage quit as a sign of their dissent. This version would help encourage continued community engagement (by making voting a prerequisite to rage quitting), while preserving the ability of the community to access funding for projects. There may be other versions that preserve and protect the values of Nouns as well. We‚Äôre committed to evaluating each proposal on its individual merits. But today the version in question is what‚Äôs proposed in Prop 248, and we‚Äôre voting no. ",248,Against,"Alana Variant decide vote Nouns Prop 248

Opinions opposing this proposal:
1. The finances for marketing proposals should be tightened. It is recommended that all marketing proposals go through the Small Grant channel. If they want to go through the on-chain major proposal channel, they must prove that there can be revenue and feedback to the treasury. The key indicator for evaluating a marketing proposal is whether or not it has a meme or story. The idea behind this proposal is obvious and lacks any story or meme.
2. Based on my current experience, I have observed that Nouns attract new community members and grow primarily through outstanding community products, the hard work of dedicated teams, the tireless promotion of Nouns by holders, and prop house rounds that demonstrate Noun's vigorous vitality of the community. However, Proposal 251 has created a Consumerism landscape that is not conducive to marketing and brand building within the community.Personally, I have no interest in marketing without incorporating memes or stories. Proposal 251 will not capture the recognition of both fashion circles and Crypto-Native partners, and instead make them feel like there is another naive buyer paying for trendy things while satisfying some people's self-perceived pleasure in effective marketing.
3. Data shows that Proposal 197 had poor execution results after implementation with only one thousand views on Twitter review proposals with sixteen retweets compared to an investment of $120k resulting in low ROI.

Opinions supporting this proposal:
1. 3D printed fashion looks good and novel.

Opinions opposing this proposal:
1. The theme of Hack Week is not clear, and the proposal is a bit rough.
2. Time. The poster indicates that it will be held from 3.27-4.2, which is very urgent. 70% of the effect of Hack Week comes from early preparation and BD, especially as an online hackathon, the promotion and BD time in the early stage needs to be longer.
3. 99 ETH expenditure is too high. It's unreasonable to hastily organize a Nouns ecosystem Hack Week for about $200,000.

Supporting views on the proposal:
1. A replicable growth model has been proven in the Nouns ecosystem. From Open Round and private voting research rounds, this is the best Nouns growth model. And every launch will attract enough attention and increase community cohesion. This proposal belongs to repeating an already successful model to promote ecological growth for Nouns with no logical problems.
2. The difference in this proposal is that Hack Week will involve more operational work than Prop House rounds without promotion or operation; this replicable model can actually be optimized by Proposal 253 for mature growth within Nouns' ecosystem.
3. Behind Proposal 253 are teams such as Nouns.build, Nouns Square, Grant Protocol etc., who together form a golden team among all proposals related to nouns - they are trustworthy due to their understanding of noun spirits as well as professionalism and execution capabilities.
4. On another note: I am concerned that overly professional requirements for proposals may stifle community atmosphere.

My bigger picture goal for it is to extend how we even think about the Nouns brand and how it spreads. How to make this into a repeatable Open Franchise kit, with the Nouns cc0 meme, open to all, such that any independent restauranter can plug into it and use aspects of it as they see fit (or not, open means use what works or nothing at all), and each one that plugs in enhances the entire network and its reach and relevance, a decentralized cc0 branded franchise. There are other elements to this stack that can be added by smart builders if they see an opportunity from loyalty/marketing/retention/rewards program/Web3 Point of Sale UX are all natural fits and some will be made in this Proposal but this model and kit will be open and evolve and incorporate what works and drop what doesn't over time.

Done well this Open Franchise Model mutually reinforces Nouns and whichever restaurants plug into it.  It could empower independent retail food service and create many proliferation opportunities that shoot off in a bunch of directions from customers to existing restaurants to people who are engaged by disruptive never before tried models.  This experiment has the potential to blaze this trail.  It will be on the team, who bring a track record running similar restaurants and businesses and who own Nouns and are committed to Nouns and are going out on a limb, to make this happen and create a model Nouns franchise.  This Proposal and the Nouns seed relationship and halo is what give it the chance to grow.

As to protections for the DAO, the cost side is what it costs to take this risk, we went back and forth on it.  Nothing seems out of whack or inflated, they are making disruptive changes to an existing business and its physical plant to effect this change.

But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a ‚ÄúSquad Vote‚Äù for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.

According to the ‚Äúsquad vote‚Äù result for proposal 254, which is 10 for, 4 against and 5 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):

Opposing views on the proposal:
1. The proposal emphasizes business model innovation, but using a points program to maintain user loyalty without any community ownership does not reflect innovative business models. Existing Web3 consumer explorations have shown that even if the community has a little bit of ownership, the effect will be very different.
2. The biggest concern is sustainability. Some long-standing old stores root themselves in the community and condense rich social relationships. However, operators in this proposal rely more on Nouns12 to maintain it. If people who have been in restaurants for a long time do not see or understand information about Nouns belonging to the community, then the relationship between such restaurants and Nouns is very fragile over time. In other words, if operators of the Nouns brand do not love their community, its actual effect on Nouns' culture and brand will be minimal.
3. I asked about restaurant ownership issues with Nouns12, and they replied that there was no connection between restaurant ownership and Nouns; it only had promotional effects on branding. From this perspective, it's not cost-effective.
4. We are unfamiliar with Australia's commercial environment and concerned about instability in offline space operations - such as local restaurant closure rates or whether it's possible to spend $200k decorating an establishment only for it to become unprofitable after one year.

Supporting views on the proposal:
1. I've always had special feelings towards physical spaces offline. Buildings are not just functional venues but also condensed things within meaning worlds that remain unchanged. Building a square in a community where social interactions occur frequently - like children playing around or lovers being intimate - remains constant while producing many interesting stories above them; layered cultures emerge from these buildings over time.Building architecture is unique because promoting culture is difficult yet when an offline entity exists long enough; interesting stories continue emerging from them creating multi-layered cultures.
2. Despite having several problems highlighted by opposing views regarding short-term benefits versus costs involved with this proposal, it's worth exploring and seeking Co-Create's consultation and assistance. This proposal takes an important step in Nouns' exploration of Web3+ consumption + offline community building, even if the concept may not be perfect.",254,Abstain,"imagine world voting exist world need rule principle world voting reality simple rule vote use squad vote proposal people vote vote abstain vote chain abstain rule

what i appreciate:

- The documentary showcases an inspiring story that aligns with the Nouns' values and could potentially resonate with a broader audience.
- The proposal aims to collaborate with an established athlete, which could bring more visibility to the Nouns ecosystem.
- Upon completion, the documentary will be minted as an Open Edition, with 50% of proceeds going to NounsDAO and 50% to the chosen charity, Life Rolls On. (Intention is great, we'll see the results) 

what i'm concerned about:

- I believe Wheelz's compensation structure could be improved by emphasizing his dedication to the project and enthusiasm for its success, rather than focusing solely on his social media following. It would be great to see a compensation model that acknowledges the time and effort he invests and highlights his genuine passion for promoting inclusive sports and inspiring others.
- Would've liked more detailed information about how the documentary will be specifically promoted or distributed, to have a better idea of the plan. 

*also would've appreciated to see a video from Wheelz himself showing his perspective on the idea.

Opposing views on the proposal:
1. I do not approve of its model. Spending $150,000 to create a rigid politically correct story for Nouns is a very bad sign. This proposal follows the traditional brand operation mindset of funding special groups and shaping their own brand image. Now NounsDAO funds an inspirational star who knows nothing about Nouns and has done nothing for Nouns, implanting a positive and optimistic brand spirit in everyone, which is an extremely rigid and inflexible brand strategy that does not fit with Nouns.
Noun's brand is a completely different model from previous brands; it is a headless brand where people feel the project's branding characteristics from community members' experiences. For the branding of Nouns, vivid stories or creatively concise memes should be used to enhance culture and build community consensus rather than funding a celebrity who has no understanding of Nouns. I strongly oppose the 256 proposal, which uses a solution that is fundamentally incompatible with both our thinking and operational methods to shape the Nouns brand.

But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a ‚ÄúSquad Vote‚Äù for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.

According to the ‚Äúsquad vote‚Äù result for proposal 257, which is 13 for, 19 against and 14 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):

Opinions opposing this proposal:
1. The past three Nouns Fairs seemed to prioritize creating a lively atmosphere more than genuinely onboarding builders, and they did not showcase Nounish ideas and products born at hackathons (perhaps it's not apparent yet, as some builders might not have built products on the spot but developed ideas later).
2. Financial details are excessively indulgent: (1) the average cost of each fair is $38,438, while the bounty for rewarding builders is only $5,000, accounting for 13%, with the rest considered as marketing costs; there is too much budget allocation for marketing surrounding the Hackthon; (2) after three iterations, some aspects could be standardized and streamlined to avoid reinventing the wheel, such as reusing materials, resulting in instances of financial waste; (3) the costs for each event vary, but in planning, each is set the same; if the funds are not fully used, will they be returned to the treasury?
3. Data does not meet expected plans. The organizer's initial goal was 1,000 Twitter followers, but after the first event, the actual number was 580. After hosting three events, Nouns Amigos currently has 1,200 followers, with the growth rate gradually decreasing and an average of 300 new followers per event.
4. In Proposal 180, the team pledged to save funds, with excess funds to be returned to NounsDAO. However, this statement is removed in the current proposal, and after 36 hours of inquiring on Discord, there has still been no response. The team has made some changes in the crucial details of the proposal's financial aspect. It makes me feel that the team deliberately doesn't want to clarify the issue of financial waste, and I am concerned about whether the team might obtain undue benefits from the implementation.

Supporting views on the proposal:
1. The issue is not whether the proposal should be implemented, but rather its cost-effectiveness. Raising Nouns' influence at Ethglobal IRL hackthons is something that should be done, with cost-effectiveness being a secondary concern.
2. The team can establish a professional Web3 event standard operating procedure (SOP).
3. The team has a track record of three successful events. The current Twitter followers are 1,000+. The average cost per follower is $50,000/1,000, or $50 per user. The data performance is at least average.

Points of uncertainty include:
1. I have not been to ETHGlobal in Mexico, Bogota, or San Francisco, so I cannot understand the local atmosphere. Moreover, the most important aspect of offline marketing proposals is the specific implementation by the two members; we need to hear firsthand opinions from those who have interacted with them. 
2. Although team have been able to execute events in the past, the team seems to have abandoned many original principles and become increasingly wasteful in the proposal, which makes me cautious.
3. NounsDAO proposals may exhibit a pattern of gradual governance attack. This starts with a few Small Grant deliveries, then bundles what should have been several small proposals into one large proposal, delivering low-quality results and pocketing the funds in between. This is an issue with the NounsDAO system. The NounsDAO system is imperfect, lacking supervision and feedback for long-term large proposals, as well as continuous incentives, potentially causing good actors to turn bad. Could Proposal 257 be an example of this gradual governance attack pattern? How can we solve this problem?
4. There are many conflicting thoughts regarding NounsDAO's financial scrutiny:
4.1 I believe that strict financial control will not yield good results, as financial systems need a mature community culture and relevant modules. Insisting on stringent requirements for any financial aspect in the absence of a solid foundation will do more harm than good to the system.
4.2 I think a 30% premium above the market rate is acceptable. Extra profit will make proposal deliveries more standardized and sustainable, reducing the sense of confusion and uncertainty for the implementing members on the cutting edge.
4.3 I can also understand the strict financial stance is resonable; if there is a 70% reduction in financial advocacy, then a 30% reduction in the financial budget may also be acceptable to the community. We should stick to strict financial discipline.",257,Abstain,"imagine world voting exist world need rule principle world voting reality simple rule vote use Squad Vote proposal people vote vote abstain vote chain abstain rule

But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a ‚ÄúSquad Vote‚Äù for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.

According to the ‚Äúsquad vote‚Äù result for proposal 258, which is 0 for, 30 against and 0 abstain, we choose to vote against.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):

Opinions opposing this proposal:
1. This is not community building. It's merely Satori and Bixbite doing business with Nouns, a business that is not advantageous for Nouns.
2. Satori and Bixbite's remarks in the Jungle channel, such as ""Lil Nouns is cheap so I gave them a cheap"" and ""Lil Nouns is a toxic environment,"" further convince me that they do not understand the spirit of the community. They display arrogance toward the individual community members, treating DAOs and communities as cold numbers. This is the worst and most repulsive proposal and proposers I have encountered.
3. NounsDAO needs to operate in a community-driven manner, incubating more teams that understand and love the Nounish spirit. Today, NounsDAO has many teams that both love Nouns and can produce outstanding work. Yet, W3BSTOCK only seeks to be an outsourcing team, proposing a disadvantageous business deal.
4. I will continue to oppose such activities that use exposure as a gimmick. The traditional growth model that relies on increased exposure is effective because it has a unified company and growth system behind it. However, the conversion rate of each aspect of this growth method would plummet in NounsDAO, rendering it ineffective. NounsDAO's growth engine comes from numerous small teams that love Nouns and have comprehensive capabilities, as well as the establishment of specific social relationships.
5. Nouns may no longer need this type of exposure.

Supporting views on the proposal:
1. A dedicated event organizer possesses sufficient professionalism.
2. They have participated in the Lilnouns community and observed the Nouns community. Although they mayn't to adapt, they have their own understanding of decentralized governance issues.

Points of uncertainty include:
1. Bitcoin has never rejected anyone. Conflicts between native and external teams can be observed in various projects. On one hand, I have seen cases where bringing in professionals to solve problems for projects ended poorly. Native teams must build every module from scratch, and there are no shortcuts. On the other hand, the MakerDAO model shows that, despite severe conflicts between native and external teams, they are not mutually exclusive at the protocol level.

But in our world, voting is a reality. So we have a simple rule: we only vote against. We use a ‚ÄúSquad Vote‚Äù for each proposal. If more people vote against than vote for or abstain, we vote against on-chain. Otherwise, we abstain. This is our rule.

According to the ‚Äúsquad vote‚Äù result for proposal 263, which is 13 for, 14 against and 19 abstain, we choose to vote abstain.The viewpoints of our different members are as follows (source not listed):

Proposal 263 has presented us with a conundrum, making it difficult for us to render judgment. The Nouns Protector has just been established, and it may take approximately six months for clarifying our principles. We will briefly summarize the debates from our meeting:

Nouns Esports has accomplished laudable outcomes, genuinely creating a stable organization to underpin esports teams' operations. This initial step is laden with myriad challenges that remain beyond our imagine. And, they have admirably maintained fiscal transparency throughout the process.

Despite their successes, the community has voiced concerns about the long-term viability of Nouns Esports as a business. Should Nouns Esports evolve into an entity that perpetually depletes NounsDAO's cash flow, depending on ceaseless transfusions from NounsDAO for sustenance, this model would not be sustainable for NounsDAO in the long run.

Furthermore, NounsDAO ought to concentrate on cultivating a more diverse and populous community. Some members posit that:

""
Nouns should channel resources into domains where it possesses an unambiguous competitive edge. Esports is not a realm where NounsDAO holds a competitive advantage. The Matthew effect is conspicuous within esports events, with elite teams monopolizing the lion's share of attention and securing funding that far exceeds $800,000. This sector is fiercely competitive. Nouns Esports cannot amass a competitive cache of funds, which means they cannot engage top-tier players nor establish a premier support infrastructure. Consequently, they will only gain exposure in regional championships and open tournaments (as evidenced by their historical performance), unable to penetrate truly valuable core events.
What merit is there in allocating excessive funds to a sphere where NounsDAO can only assume a secondary role, particularly for an organization in its nascent stages, with a community treasury of a mere $50 million?
""

""
More effective use of funds could be achieved by allocating 700 ETH to incubate 10 vibrant subculture DAOs across diverse fields, rather than expending a relatively negligible amount of funding to compete in conventional events.
""

Moreover, cautionary reminders have been raised about the pervasiveness of intimate personal relationships within NounsDAO:

""
Proposals prior to Proposal 200 have made considerable contributions to NounsDAO's present public image and clout. However, it has also engendered a nexus of relationships, with many decisions swayed by personal connections and predispositions.
If NounsDAO is to pivot towards a more lucid, native, and 'truly growth' trajectory‚Äîchampioning a broader array of NounishDAOs‚Äîthe community networks forged during the preceding strategic round may serve as impediments. As a result, more resources may be funneled towards politically correct but inefficacious marketing proposals, suppressing the potential for vibrant but peripheral creators to enter the Nouns ecosystem.
""

Notwithstanding any criticisms, Nouns Esports remains an outstanding member of NounishDAO. Additionally, esports represents an excellent conduit for Nouns to interface with the external world.

I really appreciate this proposal, it is very detailed, has tons of information and even someone who isn't particularly familiar with the subject can make an informed decision. The visual concepts also looked great and got me excited for an eventual finished project.
That being said, there are a few key issues with this proposal that pushed me to vote against.

Firstly, the team is proposing for the DAO to pay for all the manufacturing costs and the team's compensation. On top of that, they are receiving all the proceeds from the NFT sales. Seems we are double spending here. This needs to be further clarified. 
Also, it would've been great to see a % of the sales being returned back to the treasury.

Secondly, I would have liked to see more on proliferation. The keyboards themselves will most likely be sold to people already in the ecosystem. So there needs to be some work done outside of the sales of the keyboards. This possibly comes in how exactly the subDAO will operate and how It can push nounish ideas forward. In general I believe more things should be explored on this front.

I have several concerns about the mechanism design. Everyone can see the min and max bids, and so there is effectively a floor price on the auction. The incentive for the DAO and Noun holders would be to see the max bid realized and so someone could repeatedly bid (and get tips) from the auto bidder, and then outbid it, and bid again until the max bid is reached. I think in most cases it is better for someone to use a human bidder that cannot be gamed like this. If someone wants to bid at a specific price for a Noun they can just us a collection offer? 

That said, it sounds like Lil Nouns is already using this and is happy with it, and I am glad to hear it is useful to them. Beyond my concerns on the mechanism design, I don't see a reason for Nouns DAO to use this right now. 

From Twitter I gather that there is some idea here that this should be used to replace Nouns Acquisition Committee (NAC). I do not think this is a good replacement, and I would rather hold out for the paradigm where the DAO can directly vote to mint someone a Noun.

I‚Äôve gone back and forth on this proposal quite a bit. My analysis of funding requests is:
1. Is this a public good?
2. Is this public good something that other organizations won‚Äôt fund, or that Nouns is uniquely best to fund?

Writing about the Nouniverse is not necessarily a public good, but public domain writing about Nouns is. Public domain writing, just like CC0 art or freely licensed code, is composable. While the ways it could be remixed may be less obvious, it's equally important as other forms of composable creative work. 

My other lens is whether this is something that other organizations won't fund. There are many established pathways to funding books, even if they are admittedly hard to access. Nouns is also not uniquely suited to funding novels. But at the same time, these established pathways are less accessible for public domain works, which the proposal points out forgoes revenue opportunities. (That is why many books choose CC BY-NC-SA as their license, to ensure that the work is able to be shared freely by readers but not used commercially).

The concerns that other voters brought up around the size of the ask and the fact that there are other established pathways for funding books are valid. At the same time, public domain composability for books is an important experiment. While I don't yet know what composability will result from this book, I believe that it's a good experiment for Nouns. I am in support of this proposal, but would be more hesitant to vote for similar proposals until we see how the benefits of public domain composability play out for Nouns-related books.

(I would also note that I did read both chapters in full prior to making a decision, and I quite liked them. Though their quality is necessary but not sufficient for my support.)",271,For,"thesis delegate Nouns unique role ecosystem gathering place public good

I caught myself thinking that maybe I should just say ""f*ck it"" and vote yes to this prop. But after pausing for a moment I realized that's not how it should be. 
Governing the DAO on a ""let's hope for the best"" kind of mindset is not feasible.

Sure, I could ignore my concerns with this proposal. Like it not having any distribution plans or the unexplained cost or even the fact that an open mint is just selling it to ourselves...
But is that what Nouns are about? Trusting that something is nounish enough and hoping it works out? I don't believe so.

I have nothing against the idea of a Nounish children's book per se. As a matter of fact I think it's a great idea. One of my core beliefs as a Nouner is that we should heavily fund creative people and initiatives.
What I am against though, is not having a plan.
We have to change the mindset that being nounish = throwing caution to the wind and fund anything. Not having something amazing to support is not an excuse to fund anything.

Recent Props like 256(Triple backflip in a Wheelchair) or 263(Nouns Esports) are perfect examples of what we should be funding. They are creative ideas by people that can deliver and have a plan. That's nounish, nounish af.

To Tasha, I would encourage you to bring back a revised version of this prop with more details. Explaining why the cost makes sense for this project, compare it to other known authors and market rates for this kind of work.

17188578,0xa2e41625416d46302e7352f56f8de92aadb6e886,False,0,1,"Alana here, from Variant. We‚Äôve decided to vote against Prop 271.

Our rationale stems from a mix of concerns regarding alignment with the broader goal of NounsDAO, the effectiveness of propagating the Nouns meme, and the justification of the cost of the proposal.

One of the things that excited us most about joining NounsDAO was its mission of funding public goods and the self-sustaining mechanism it invented to continue to do so. A middle-grade novel strikes us as distinct from more powerful public goods initiatives we‚Äôve seen, like cleaning up trash in Africa or funding the planting of trees. We‚Äôd love to see Nouns devoting funding toward bigger, more ambitious projects.

Second, the proposal contains no plans for distribution of the novel. Key to Nouns‚Äô mission is propagating the meme. Creation of content is important, but the true execution is in distribution. Even if we imagine that the novel achieves moderate success, the distribution will be most potent among children (likely 7-10 year-olds, i.e. the ones who read the novel). In our view, that‚Äôs not the target audience for Nouns; the funding mechanism only works if people feel compelled to buy into the community, and creating emotional ties with children may struggle to fulfill the Nouns flywheel (auction funds Treasury ‚Üí Treasury funds projects ‚Üí projects increase demand for the auction ‚Üí and so on) in the short-medium term.  

Third, 25 ETH for this proposal feels expensive, at least with the justification for funds given in the prop. To date, we have tried to avoid debates on the cost of funding associated with proposals, given a key component of Nouns is the ability to easily unlock funding for unique and attention-grabbing experiments. 25 ETH without any plans for exogenous distribution ‚Äì and simply a plan to release a timed open edition (where demand for the mint will likely be endogenous from the Nouns community) ‚Äì seems a potentially ineffective use of funds. That‚Äôs not to say there may not be a strong justification for 25 ETH without a go-to-market plan; rather, we simply did not see one in the proposal. A more effective request, for instance, would have included detail about market comps for the cost of publication to better benchmark a reasonable expected cost. 

The reason we feel compelled to mention funding here is because we want to prevent the setting of a precedent in which the Nouns Treasury is seen as a free money machine. Funding should be easily accessible, but should match the boldness or proliferation expected with each proposal.

One thing of note is that the creator feels part of the 25 ETH is necessary to compensate them for forgoing future revenue streams; in other words, the upfront payment covers for the lack of a longer-term stake in the success of the novel. To us, this suggests there may be a better way than pure ETH grants to reward creators for contributing to the community: find a way to give them a stake in the success of Nouns. We‚Äôve been exploring ideas related to this challenge in incentive alignment, and hope to have additional ideas to share with the community soon.

And finally, we‚Äôre still excited by this proposal and appreciate the author‚Äôs hard work. We encourage the author to resubmit a proposal, with a revised plan for funding and/or more detail on distribution for the project.

I feel strongly that Nouns should not have a namespace that distinguishes between ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù projects and all other projects. Once a project is viewed as canonical, it will be hard to dislodge. Nouns should have a healthy ecosystem where projects naturally form and die. This allows contributors to step up, and just as importantly allows contributors to move on.

Much of this perspective is influenced by the Loot community, where projects viewed as ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù had significantly more sway among users than equivalent projects that were not viewed as ‚Äúcanonical‚Äù. If Nouns begins to bless certain projects with a canonical namespace, it will take energy away from non-canonical projects.

One simple hypothetical: What if Agora had a canonical namespace at nouns.agora.eth but House of Nouns did not? Is Agora now more ‚Äúofficial‚Äù than House of Nouns? Should we bless more projects with official namespaces, to put them on a level playing field? What happens when those projects evolve, sometimes in ways that an official namespace would not like?

This is a slippery slope and I am opposed for that reason. As a courtesy, I registered nounsautobidder.eth and autobiddernouns.eth under my ENS at Papper.eth (also the owner, not the manager, of this ENS).

17174668,0x3cbd57da2f08b3268da07e5c9038c11861828637,True,1,1,"My thesis as a delegate is: ‚ÄúNouns has a unique role in the ecosystem as a gathering place around public goods.‚Äù

Funding crypto regulatory advocacy is an excellent example of a public good. It is something that benefits the entire ecosystem, and it is something that many groups won‚Äôt fund. This funding is especially powerful coming from a more neutral organization like Nouns. Advocacy from VC funds and companies is excellent and their work is incredibly important, but Nouns serves a special role by decoupling its advocacy from direct financial interests. This advocacy also benefits Nouns and other DAOs, which lack significant amounts of regulatory clarity.

I understand concerns by Scott and others that regulatory advocacy is off-mission (https://twitter.com/scott_lew_is/status/1652699651265503233). Those concerns are thoughtful, and I agree that Nouns is not and should not be an advocacy organization for regulatory change. At the same time, I draw a strong distinction between funding advocacy and directly participating in advocacy. Funding advocacy in my mind is on-mission as a public good, but participating in advocacy is likely something that the existing advocacy groups can do far better than Nouns. As long as Nouns sticks to funding only, advocacy can be an effective public good.

That being said, I wish this proposal was stronger in its advocacy for Nouns PR. In my opinion, Nouns is not aggressive enough in advertising its donations, and that hinders it from attracting people and acting as a beacon for public goods. Claiming the top spot on the leaderboard is a good start, but I wish the proposal went further on advocating for Nouns publicity. A few things that I wish were addressed in the proposal:
1. Nouns would be putting up 50% of the funding for the crypto advocacy round (Coinbase put up the other $100K, with the rest being direct donations from users), but the description on the Gitcoin Grants Round only states that  ‚ÄúCoinbase is on a mission to advocate for digital asset policies here in the United States, and this crypto advocacy round will support the amazing organizations who are leading the charge.‚Äù I would love a commitment from Coinbase and/or Gitcoin to include Nouns in the description of the advocacy round if this proposal passes. Coinbase, Gitcoin, and Nouns are stronger together! This is a collaboration I‚Äôd love to see.
2. I wish that Nouns had suggestions on how the advocacy organizations that will benefit from the matching funds could collaborate with Nouns. These don‚Äôt need to be requirements, merely suggestions. For example, welcoming advocacy organizations and their members to participate in the Nouns Playground and set a Nouns from the Playground as their PFP would set a nice norm, whether or not those groups choose to adopt it. (I also recognize that in this case, the amount is on the smaller side for that kind of PR.)
3. The history of the Shield emoji and Coinbase is something that I wish the proposal clearly discussed. It‚Äôs worth noting that the Shield emoji is repurposed from the ‚ÄúCoinbase FUD protection squad‚Äù (https://twitter.com/lay2000lbs/status/1551956224232628224) and was previously used by Coinbase employees and supporters to signal support for Coinbase as a company. While there are only so many shield emoji available, it is relevant for Nouns voters to know that they‚Äôre participating in an initiative that is repurposing symbols that supported Coinbase as symbols to support the industry. I am perfectly fine with this, but the history is relevant as Nouns thinks about how much it benefits from branding here.

In short, while Nouns could do more to advocate for itself and get stronger PR benefits from this, I am in support of this proposal. Funding regulatory advocacy is a public good that benefits the ecosystem, and I believe it matches Nouns‚Äôs mission as long as Nouns sticks to funding only.",278,For,"thesis delegate Nouns unique role ecosystem gathering place public good

I had actually looked into getting setup but didn't feel like buying an old phone. Having a preinstalled option on the latest phone will be huge.

I wish the ask was larger, with a clear narrative of how our funding can be a key differentiator for the team, and a better story around how Nouns can be featured: e.g. a Noggle easter egg on all phones?

Nonetheless, I am voting FOR! Because 
1. After talking with the proposers, it seems they went with the lower amount after informally getting pushback on a bigger ask. This will be the largest funding amount they've received to date and really will meaningfully help them get to market quicker.

Cons: Skeptical that a new OS is what gets people to switch their current phone just for cryptonative benefits. Much more likely that dominant crypto adoption comes through app diversity in established OS app stores, or via browser functionality within a web3 app (like what Metamask does today).
 
Net: Positive - Despite the visible difficulties of new OS adoption, if anyone can help fund a run on a new system its Nouns DAO.

My analysis of funding requests is:
1. Is this a public good?
2. Is this public good something that other organizations won‚Äôt fund, or that Nouns is uniquely best to fund?

This proposal wants to build a sustainable, profitable business. Which is excellent! But it‚Äôs not building a public good. Likewise, there are many outlets for funding CPG branding plays, though they do often require some upfront capital.

This proposal also feels like a ‚Äúproliferate the meme‚Äù type of proposal, which is fun and interesting, but doesn‚Äôt serve public goods.

For this reason, I was tempted to vote Against. At the same time, as I was analyzing this proposal, I began to think of all of the ways this brand could serve public goods-oreineted goals.

The design contest is an obvious starting point. Inviting artists to participate, and ideally having commissions or a portion of the profits flow back to them, is one way. The community contributions are strong here, showing that this brand is already acting as a gathering place.

It could also help other groups bootstrap knowledge in building CPG brands. Ideally, the team could aid other groups wanting to launch Nouns-related CPG projects. In the long run, fewer of these projects would need to be funded by the DAO and could instead be funded by an ecosystem of self-sustaining CPG brands.

For this reason, my inclination is to say yes to experimentation. I‚Äôd want to wait and see how this plays out before approving similar props. Does this end up as a community driven CPG initiative? If so, amazing! Does this continue forever as a self-sustaining wet wipes business business? A wonderful thing, but probably something that should have been funded by other venues.

Most of my votes as a delegate focus on the ‚Äúpublic goods‚Äù part of my thesis. This one is more unique, since it focuses on the ‚Äúgathering place‚Äù part of the thesis.

Explaining what Nouns does is extremely important. Even within Nouns, there are differing visions of the goal: A space for public goods? A meme to proliferate? A treasury that should focus on growth? When Nouns itself has so many different visions, it becomes especially important to synthesize and explain those visions to the world.

As someone who‚Äôs worked on explaining complex spaces like DAOs from scratch, I know that this is really, really hard. Getting the messaging right, finding the right balance between simplicity and nuance, and then getting the content out into the world takes a long time.

Just like how crypto startups shouldn‚Äôt decentralize before they have product-market fit, crypto media shouldn‚Äôt decentralize before they have ‚Äúnarrative-market fit‚Äù.

I understand the desire to decentralize. I understand the concern about reach. I understand the hesitation about the size of the ask. But the reality is that, in my opinion, it‚Äôs too early for those things. Nouns needs to figure out how to tell its story, and frankly it‚Äôs not very good at it right now. Before we add many narratives and styles into the mix ‚Äî which we should! ‚Äî we should try to get one right.

Let‚Äôs see what Nounish produces, give them time to accomplish the huge task in front of them, and then fund even more voices. Their content is easy to discover and remix ‚Äî that is already a foundation for others to build on top of. The decentralization and reach will come in due time.

I think the DAO funding competent, self-directed teams is an efficiency win and makes sense. Sometimes the most efficient decentralization is empowering several centralized teams!

I absolutely open to funding other teams or organizing our spending through different means: prop house or whatever.

Please read this image and the new disclamer of the proposal changes accordinly with the community feedback. We lowered the sponsorship package, adapted the metaverse action and we are collaborating with aubtoshi for merch, the proposal is 55% cheaper but as Nounish as it can be. We made everything possible to make this happen, would be just SAD to all of us if it didnt.

This is not just an event. With the event coming, we had the chance to prepare a great OOH media operation, and we created this great package of proliferation, onboarding and celebration. Nouns is already displayed in airports in the moment I am typing this comment. And Bob Burnquist, one of the founders and speakers, will be explaining nouns for thousand of people in the event and also in broadcast TV like he did  yesterday.  

Among other great achievements like bringing Van Gogh, Kobe Bryant and Michael Jacksons pieces sold in NFTs to the eyes of 5000 kids from G10 favelas project that will be brought to the expo with the help of Sao Paulo city mayor.

I‚Äôm voting against this prop. This conference seems pretty generic as far as NFT/ tech conferences go and I question how much value Nouns will get out of a sponsored presence. That being said, communication from the conference and proposing team has been *inconsistent* at best. 

One of the biggest issues I noticed was 1/3 of the prop money ($30k) would go to a conference ‚Äúsponsorship‚Äù and I still can‚Äôt figure out what we would get for that sponsorship. 

In the conference brochure there isn‚Äôt a $30k sponsorship package listed, although the team claims they were able to negotiate with ‚Äúinner web3 circle‚Äù for a better deal. 

The sponsorship packages listed in the provided brochure are: $12k, $20k, $40k, $80k, and $200k. So what do we get for our $30k sponsorship exactly? One member of the team mentioned they negotiated the $80k package down to $30k, another member said we are getting the $200k package for $30k. I‚Äôm still left trying to figure out what we get for a $30k sponsorship and how can we verify this?  

I requested that the team provide an invoice or some documentation of this $30k sponsorship package and what comes with it, but as of this vote I have not received this. 

There are also inconsistent metrics cited for expected number of attendees. In the prop text, the proposing team claims 30,000 attendees are expected, but then in provided conference graphics the claim is 40,000 attendees are expected.

What a gem of a proposal. 

First and foremost I love the focus on defining what you want Nouns to mean. The culture, values, and general vibe. Positivity, health, organic local community growth. This all feels very wholesome and I like the effort here. I chuckled at the R in FRENS: ""Refrain from promoting your project or business"". Lol.

You already have existing clubs, you're already running. Thousands of cumulative KM run is an excellent success metric. Adding some Nounish swag makes a lot of sense to me.

To Noun 12's point - I think an interesting path forward is for these running clubs to remain self-sustaining groups that continue to exist regardless of Nouns funding. That means not depending on Nouns funding for general operations, instead just focusing DAO bucks specifically on Nouns proliferation. Something to think about when starting new groups. These clubs are much more valuable to us if they aren't temporary and plan to exist with or without further funding.

1. A continued focus on CC0. The art is all interesting, mostly for skimming though. I can actually use the CC0 content! I can put it in videos, art, put it on a shirt. The more this focuses on CC0 media the more it enables and encourages viral permissionless growth of Nouns.

2. The Nouns DAO on-chain proposals section needs to be fleshed out more, and could also be a serious justification for this project. Each funded DAO proposal should have a ton of meta-media. Behind the scenes shots, interviews with the proposer, images from the on-chain prop, screenshots and screen recordings of anything digital. Currently most props have 1-4 images and it doesn't feel comprehensive. Work with the prop submitters and teams to really get a thorough pile of media from them.

3. Better top-level organization of content. I don't really understand the difference between NOUNS SPECIAL and NOUNS WORLD and NOUNS on the front page - it should be way more intuitive. Each item on the front page needs to be essential and obvious.

4. This prop is probably too focused on the design and tech. It looks beautiful, and the arweave uploader is cool, but I think the focus really needs to be on usability, figuring out exactly what needs this fulfills, and on the content itself.

the r&d costs associated with this proposal are very reasonable. with the recent arrival of frore's airjet solid state cooling chips, there's an opportunity to revolutionise mini PCs. i'd expect this to have a major impact on ethereum staking nodes, especially since most are built on standard mini PC implementations. it's an exciting time to get involved in this design space, especially from a public goods perspective. i'd love to see what collaborative opportunities arise from our involvement as strong proponents for solo staking. most setups are still very much diy and often a hodgepodge of off-the-shelf components.

i understand that those with solo staking experience such as noun40, who've pieced together a mini PCs, don't expect people choosing to run on raspberry pi type setups. but with the advancement of revolutionary cooling tech, that's exactly where we are headed. taking a public goods approach to this design space is itself a competitive edge and would likely get the attention of those reporting on the space. 

regarding proliferation of a project such as this, i'd recommend starting at the hobbyist level, by reaching out to those with cult followings such as [n-o-d-e.net](https://n-o-d-e.net/) / [mosfet.net](https://mosfet.net/) who already take an interest in crypto and have done so since the early days.

yes, hardware is hard, but not so much when it's your area of expertise and you're playing in a collaborative space that leans heavily on open source, open standards, and expansible systems componentry. 

i'd be happy to consult to 5oc on the gtm for this type of project. i've worked extensively on the development and marketing of new products in energy management and tenancy billing that are analogous to solo staking nodes. there are a number of unique systems integrator approaches we could take and the unique brand positioning and public goods focus is very compelling imho.

- Could we first fund an exploration to build a proof of concept machine? I think people will be excited by some proof they can see. 
- Are we sure that going for a validator is the best simplification of the original prop (281)? I really liked the original prop's focus on hobbyists and learning. This feels Nounish. Is there a way we can push in this direction at a lower cost? Again, just a proof of concept people can get excited about? 
- Nounish design is cool, but where can we gain the most from your expertise? Are there any huge pain points we can solve since we'll be going 0 to 1? It feels like a lot of the work for a validator may be redundant? 
- In general, I'd say don't hesitate to discuss with any and all Nouners to find the most exciting version of this, and then make sure to pitch that here. E.g. for this prop I think this may have amounted to one of the cheaaper validator options on the market, but this aspect wasn't really pitched.
